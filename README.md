## Overview
  
### Goal
Cooking for yourself is hard, especially the  
thinking about what to cook for dinner part.

I wanted to create a program that gathers up  
some fun and delicious recipes and can send  
them to my email using smtp daily.

  - flask 

-- To Be Implemented --
- __HTML and CSS__
  - styled w/ styled components
- __JavaScript__
  - Next.js
  - React.js
- deployed w/ netlify


## Process/Journey
I started off by studying the html of the web page  
(after checking the robots.txt ofc), I wrote some  
notes about the DOM elements I was gonna reference  
and then I wrote some code to get the data I wanted,  
I then started organizing the data, I first stored  
it as a text file then made a function to convert  
it into a json format 

### Learned
I got more comfortable, referenceing dom elements  
using bs4 and also storing data in a variety of formats.
