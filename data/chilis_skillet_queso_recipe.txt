It Takes Two

Simplicity is the best, and this recipe is just about as simple as it can get. There are only two ingredients: Velveeta cheese and Hormel No-Bean Chili. Yep, that is it. From these humble ingredients, greatness is achievable, so don’t screw things up by trying to get all fancy.

Sure, you could slave over a hot stove for hours and spend ten times as much money to make your Bean-less chili and cheese sauce, but you wouldn’t end up with something as tried-and-true as this skillet queso recipe. Instead, trust tradition and go with a block of yellow cheese and a red can. You won’t regret it.


First, Let’s Get the Difficult Stuff Out of the Way

When the most complicated part of a recipe is melting cheese, you know that even your teens or kitchen-phobic spouse can handle it on their own. Yet, inept cooks have a history of messing up when it comes to boiling water, so here are a few tricks you may want to pass along.
- Cut the block of cheese up into small cubes. Doing this will let the cheese melt quicker, more evenly and help avoid any scorching.
- Don’t melt the cheese alone. Combine the cubed cheese with the Hormel chili in a large enough saucepan for the mixture only to reach halfway up the sides. Place the saucepan over low heat.
- Stir continuously. That means stir from the moment the pan goes on the heat until you take it off, keep that mixture moving. Alternate between a circular and a figure-eight stirring pattern to ensure the ingredients in the center of the pot doesn’t burn.
- Take the saucepan off the heat once the cheese melts and the chili is hot. Stir a few more times once you take off the heat.


Tips for Serving and Reheating Chili’s Queso Dip
- Smooth things out. Some people like the dip a little on the chunky side, but those who don’t can blend it. The best way to get a smooth consistency is by using a stick blender directly in the pot. While it is possible to use a regular blender to puree the dip in batches, things will get a bit messy.
- This is much more than just a dip. Use this recipe the same way you would use any sauce. You can top a plate of fries or a baked potato. Throw in pasta shells for a meaty mac and cheese. Pour it on top of a hamburger or hotdog, or even spread it on toasted bread for an instant grilled cheese sandwich.
- Store covered in the fridge for 2-3 days. Reheat by cutting the congealed dip into cubes and heating over low heat on the stovetop. Alternatively, you can warm it in the microwave.

Ingredients

You only need two simple ingredients to make this delicious chili con queso:
- Velveeta cheese
- Canned chili without beans

I personally stock up on canned chili right before the Super Bowl. Some people like to use canned chili with beans, but this is entirely a personal preference.


How to Make Chili’s Skillet Queso

Simply heat the ingredients together in a skillet or saucepan over low heat until the cheese has melted, stirring often.

For the most accurate texture, you should puree the cooked dip in a blender.
