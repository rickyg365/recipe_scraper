Frank’s Hot Sauce Buffalo Chicken Dip Recipe Ingredients

With only five ingredients, this buffalo chicken dip is spicy, delicious, and addicting. Here are the ingredients you need to gather:
- Chicken – I like to make this with chicken breasts or chicken tenders
- Cream Cheese
- Frank’s RedHot Sauce – do not use the Frank’s Buffalo Wing Sauce – it won’t taste the same 
- Ranch Salad Dressing
- Cheddar Cheese

CopyKat Tip: Use freshly grated cheese. Packaged shredded cheese contains chemicals to aid in separation and doesn’t melt as well.


Buffalo Chicken Dip – Ingredient Substitutions
- If you like the flavor of Frank’s Red Hot Sauce but want less heat, halve the hot sauce and increase the ranch dressing to one full cup. 
- If you really love extra spicy food, use Frank’s extra-hot buffalo sauce.
- For a non-dairy buffalo chicken dip, use non-dairy cheese substitutes. 


How to Make Buffalo Chicken Dip

This Frank’s hot sauce buffalo chicken dip is really easy to make. Here are the simple steps:
- If the chicken is not cooked, you will need to cook it and then shred it. You can boil or bake it.
- Place the cream cheese in a microwave-safe bowl.
- Microwave the cream cheese until it is softened enough to stir, about 20 seconds.
- Add the remaining ingredients to the bowl and stir until combined.
- Place the mixture in a baking dish or cast iron skillet.
- Bake at 350 degrees until bubbly, about 25 minutes.


Crockpot Buffalo Chicken Dip

Making Buffalo chicken dip in a Crock Pot is simple to do and there’s only 1 step (unless you need to cook and shred the chicken). Here’s how:

- Place the dip mixture in an oven-safe dish that fits in your air fryer basket or tray.
- Air fry at 350°F for 16 minutes.


Recipe Variations

If you like this buffalo chicken dip, there are variations that you may want to try:
- You can choose to use a rotisserie chicken. It adds another dimension of flavor and really breaks up well to give the dip a great texture.
- If you love the flavor of blue cheese, swap out the ranch dressing for blue cheese dressing. You could also toss in about 1/3 of a cup of blue cheese crumbles.
- You can also swap out the Cheddar cheese for Monterey Jack, Colby-Jack or a Tex-Mex blend.
- Top your dip withs a sprinkle of sliced green onions.


How to Serve Buffalo Chicken Dip

You can serve this tasty dip cold, but it’s best served warm. A great way to keep this warm is to use a Crockpot on the counter or to take it with you on the go.

If you bake it in a dish, use a thermal carrier to keep your container warm.
