Why are these Mini Corn Dogs so amazing?

While this recipe might be extremely easy, it is still homemade. The corn dog breading for this recipe creates the perfect crisp outside with a nice fluffy inside which is the perfect texture for the best corn dog.  


What do corn dogs taste like?

Corn dogs are hot dogs that are fried with a corn dog batter. So if you have ever had a hot dog, imagine that but add a sweet and fluffy coating on top. 

The sweetness comes from the cornmeal and there is a wonderful crispy outside from frying the mini corn dog, which adds even more flavor to this delicious corn dog recipe. It tastes like heaven!

How to Cook Mini Corn Dogs in Air Fryer

You will make the batter the same but instead of frying the corn dogs in oil, you will use the air fryer.

Here are the steps and how to make mini corn dogs in an air fryer:
- Make the batter (see details above or in the recipe card).
- Put a piece of parchment paper on the bottom of the air fryer basket and place the dipped pieces of hot dog on it.
- Then set the air fryer to 375 and set the timer for 8 minutes.
- Half way through, open up the air fryer and flip the mini corn dogs. 
- When there is 2 minutes left, check the corn dogs each minute to check for doneness.


What goes good with mini corn dogs?

While you can totally eat these delicious little corn dogs by themselves, here are a few options for what to serve with them:
- JoJo Potatoes
- Greek Roasted Potatoes
- Outback Aussie Fries
- Taco Bell Nacho Fries


How to Store and Reheat Mini Corn Dogs

The mini corn dogs will last in the fridge for about 5 days when stored in an airtight container. 

When you want to eat them again you can either use the air fryer to reheat them by placing them back in the air fryer for 3 to 4 minutes at 375 degrees. 

If you don’t have an air fryer, preheat the oven to 400 degrees and bake them for 5 to 7 minutes or until they are heated all the way through. 

Or if you are looking for a quick way to reheat them, you can pop them in the microwave for 30 to 45 seconds. However, using the microwave will make them a little soggy.


Freezing Instructions

If you would like to freeze corn dogs, once they have cooled down, place them in a freezer-safe zip-top bag and put them in the freezer.

They will last for up to 3 months frozen!
