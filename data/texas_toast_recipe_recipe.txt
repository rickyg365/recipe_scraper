Texas Toast garlic bread is crispy, buttery toasted bread with a touch of garlic and parmesan cheese. One thing is for certain it can be the star of your next meal. 

Many years ago, I worked in a restaurant, and we made Texas Toast every day. I personally loved to dunk Texas Toast into gravy or make a BLT with two slices of this delicious bread. Texas Toast is like Texas – big and bold, and it makes any sandwich twice as tasty. 


What Is Texas Toast?

Texas Toast is not your plain ordinary toast. Rather it’s a crispy, buttery toasted bread with a touch of garlic and a sprinkle of parmesan cheese. This toast is crisp and crunchy on the outside and buttery and soft on the inside.


Why Do They Call It Texas Toast?

While everything may be bigger in Texas, this toast wasn’t made big intentionally. It actually began life as an accident. According to Wikipedia, this toast is considered Texas Toast because it got its start in Beaumont, Texas, when a bakery sliced some bread too thick. The bread was so large it wouldn’t fit in the toaster. So the cook thought he would butter the bread and put it on a griddle.


What Are the Differences Between Texas Toast and Garlic Bread?

The main difference is in the type of bread that is used. Texas Toast is made with thick slices of bread, which can be toasted under a broiler, whereas garlic bread is created from French bread and baked in the oven. Texas Toast can be made with garlic powder but garlic bread generally uses fresh garlic. 


You Can Enjoy Texas Toast in Any State

Love for this thick-cut, buttery garlic toast has spread well beyond the Lone Star State. These days many grocery stores sell thickly-sliced bread for making Texas Toast. Now keep in mind that this bread doesn’t come already toasted unless it’s in the frozen food section. However, you can easily make your own Texas Toast from scratch.


Tips for Making Texas Toast
- If you can’t find a Texas Toast loaf in the bread aisle, you can ask your grocery store bakery to slice a loaf of Italian bread into thick slices. Honestly, when I have made this toast, I have sometimes used regular sliced bread. Either way, it will work great. If you buy untoasted Texas Toast bread, you can use the rest of the loaf for French toast.
- This Texas Toast recipe uses your broiler. If you use a griddle or pan, be sure to preheat it for extra crispiness.
- I think the real key to making good Texas Toast is making sure you toast both sides of the bread evenly. You want each side to be indistinguishable from the other.
- For this Texas toast recipe, you add just a little bit of parmesan cheese to give it a nutty flavor. You could add cheddar or mozzarella, or just about any type of cheese will work well.
- If you do not like garlic, use seasoned salt instead.
- Add chopped parsley or dill.
- The most obvious variation to make with Texas toast is to use it whenever you need to serve a sandwich or flatbread. For instance, using Texas Toast for a BLT can add another dimension to this popular sandwich. 
- Trying out various cheeses and toppings like pepperoni lets you go from Texas Toast to mini-pizzas that are sure to please a crowd.
- Texas Toast goes well with a caesar or spinach salad.
