What Are Vegetable Samosas?

A vegetable samosa is a savory pastry enjoyed at Indian restaurants. It can be an appetizer, snack, or entrée. The filling is made with potato, peas, chilies, ginger, and even more ingredients to amp up the flavor.


Why Vegetable Samosas Make a Great Party Appetizer

One of the nice things about veggie samosas is that they make wonderful appetizers for parties. It is great finger food and a delicious vegetarian option for your guests.

Veggie samosas are hearty so you won’t need to make a bunch of other appetizers.

You can make them up in big batches, fry what you need, and then save the rest.

Best of all, you will be everyone’s favorite person for making them!


Samosa Ingredients

Here’s everything you will need to make this Indian samosa recipe. Don’t let the long list intimidate you, it is worth it, I promise.

For the dough:
- All-purpose flour
- Water
- Oil
- Salt
- Ajwain seed powder (optional)

For the filling:
- Potatoes 
- Green peas
- Green Chilies
- Ginger
- Coriander
- Cashews (optional)
- Raisins (optional)
- Garam masala
- Salt
- Chili powder
- Dry mango powder (optional)
- Vegetable oil (for frying)


How to Make Vegetable Samosas

There are three parts to this samosa recipe. Here are the steps for making the dough, filling, and putting them together:

To make the dough:
- Mix the salt, flour, oil, and ajwain together.
- Once those are mixed together add the water a little at a time while mixing. Then pat and knead the dough until it is soft and pliable.
- When the dough is done, cover it with a moist cloth and set it aside. 

To make the filling:
- Mix the mashed potatoes, salt, chili powder, mango powder, garam masala, finely chopped green chilies, and crushed ginger together.
- After that is all mixed together, add in the boiled green peas, chopped cashews, raisins, and coriander. Mix it all together.

To make the samosas:
- Make small balls of dough and roll them out until they are about 4 to 5 inches in diameter.
- Then cut the flat circle in half to form a semicircle shape.
- Take one of the semicircles and fold it to form a cone shape. Use a little water on the seam and then place a spoon full of the filling in the cone.
- Once it is filled, seal up the remaining side with a drop of water.
- Continue this until all the dough and/or filling is gone.
- Then heat your oil in a kadhai or deep frying pan to 350°F and cook the pastry until it is golden brown.


Recipe Variations

Since this pastry has a veggie filling you can change out the vegetables if you desire.

You can also use boiled carrots or even add more peppers. 

Add in some sesame seeds, celery seeds, or a little bit of curry powder as well.


How to Serve Potato Samosa 

Vegetable Samosas are best served warm with a delicious dipping sauce. Chutney and raita (yogurt dip) are the most popular.


What Goes With Vegetable Samosa?

This savory pastry can be served along with other appetizers at a party or as a main dish with these sides:
- Cucumber Onion Salad
- Garden Salad
- Roasted Cauliflower
- Steamed Green Beans


How to Store Leftover Vegetable Samosas

These will store best in an airtight container in your fridge for up to 4 days. After that, they will tend to get a little soggy.

If you want to store them for longer, place them on a tray in the freezer for 2 hours to freeze them individually, and then store them in a freezer bag for up to 4 months. 


How to Reheat Leftover Veggie Samosas

To preserve the amazing texture of this dish I would suggest either baking them in the oven at 375°F until they are heated all the way through or in the air fryer at 375°F for 5 to 7 minutes.

By using those methods, you will not have soggy leftovers, rather you will enjoy a crispy, spicy, and delicious potato samosa yet again!
