What Is Chicken Liver Pâté?

Chicken liver pâté is a variation on much more expensive foie gras, which is made from duck or goose livers. Foie gas is a costly and highly-controversial delicacy because of the way it is produced.

Chicken Liver Pâté Recipe Ingredients

This ridiculously easy chicken liver pâté recipe can be put together in about 20 minutes with just 5 ingredients, not counting salt and pepper. However, it’s a good idea to plan to make it in advance because the flavors develop while the pâté chills! Here are the ingredients:
- Fresh chicken livers
- Olive oil
- Onion
- Dry Marsala wine
- Hard-boiled eggs
- Salt
- Ground black pepper


Ingredient Substitutions

Wine: Instead of Marsala wine, you can use a dry white wine, brandy, chicken broth, or just water.

Fat: Chopped liver in the Jewish tradition uses schmaltz (rendered chicken fat flavored with onions) instead of vegetable oil.

Cracklings: Add gribenes to your pâté liver. Gribenes are the crispy cracklings created when you render schmaltz (often referred to as Jewish bacon).

Toppings: You can fancy up your chopped liver by topping it with crostini and/or chopped parsley or chives.


How to Make Chicken Liver Pâté
- Rinse and drain the chicken livers, discarding anything that looks unusually colored.
- Heat the oil in a pan over medium heat.
- Add the onions and sauté until they are golden brown. Remove the onions from the pan.
- Add the chicken livers to the pan and cook them for about 15 minutes, until done. Add more oil to the pan if needed. Remove the livers from the pan.
- Deglaze the pan with Marsala, dry white wine, chicken broth, or water.
- Process the livers and 2 hard-boiled eggs by chopping them finely, running them through a grinder, or pulsing them a few times in a food processor.
- Return the livers, eggs, and onions to the pan and stir to combine.
- Transfer the mixture to a bowl, cover it, and set it in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours.
- Before serving, chop one more hard-boiled egg and place it on top of the pâté.

I like to store chopped liver pate for a day or two before serving. It tastes better on the 2nd day.


What to Serve With Chicken Liver Pâté
- Crostini is easy to prepare and a great bread to serve with pâté.
- Store-bought or homemade crackers.
- Crusty baguette.
- As a light supper with parsley potatoes.
- Red wine pairs perfectly with pâté.

Chopped chicken liver pâté is perfect for parties as part of a fancy charcuterie board (meat and cheese plate).


How to Store Pâté Liver

Chopped liver pâté can be stored in the refrigerator for a day or two before serving. In fact, it tastes better the second day.

Refrigerator: Tightly covered chicken liver pâté will be ok in the fridge for up to a week. To refrigerate it for up to a month, pour a little melted clarified butter or lard on top to make a seal. Every time you spoon out some pâté, you will need to reseal the top.

Freezer: Wrap leftover pâté tightly in plastic wrap followed by a layer of foil, an airtight freezer-safe container, or a freezer-safe zip-top bag. Your pâté will be good in the freezer for up to 3 months. Thaw the pâté overnight in the refrigerator.
