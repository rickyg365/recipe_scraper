It doesn’t get any more basic than fried potatoes. But just because something is simple doesn’t mean it can’t be delicious as well! That is especially true when you are enjoying these upscale air fryer potato wedges. Air fried potatoes give you the taste and texture you love without all the extra fat and calories of deep frying. With a sprinkling of spices and cheese, these high-end home fries are more than just your everyday fried spuds. Whether you are serving them as a side or a standalone snack, you and your family won’t be able to get enough of these air-fried potatoes.


Choosing the Perfect Potato

To get the most from this potato wedges air fryer recipe, you have to use the best potatoes. You probably already know that there are many types of potatoes available at the store, like, russet, fingerling, red, white, and yellow. It can all get confusing pretty quickly.

To make it as simple as possible, people usually divide potatoes into two categories: waxy and starchy varieties. Still, some potatoes have characteristics from both types. For frying in an air fryer, or even in oil, you should choose a starchy potato.

One of the most popular frying potatoes is russets because they are dense and have a low moisture level preventing steaming and promoting a crunchy exterior and a soft, creamy interior. Almost all supermarkets carry russets, but sometimes they are marketed as Idaho potatoes. While the first choice for making potato wedges in the air fryer are russets, some folks prefer the Yukon gold potatoes for their buttery taste and slight sweetness. Just stay away from any waxy potatoes like red, fingerling, or any ‘baby’ potatoes, unless you like eating gummy fries.


Prepping the Potatoes

Once you bring home the perfect potatoes, it is time to prepare them.

Your first big decision is whether you want to peel them. While it is a personal choice, if you plan on leaving the skin on, you should probably be sure to purchase organic potatoes and still give them a good cleaning with a potato brush.

Slice your potatoes in half the long way, and then each half into quarters. Turn each quarter of the potato up so the cut edge is facing you and slice into eighths. It is essential to try to keep each potato wedge approximately the same thickness to ensure they all cook at the same speed.

Now rinse the potato wedges off to remove any excess starch and place in a large bowl with enough water to cover the potato wedges. You can add a tablespoon of lemon juice to help prevent discoloration. Let soak for half an hour and then dry thoroughly.


Tips For Making and Serving Air Fryer Potato Wedges
- Spray potatoes with sugar water after seasoning. The sugar will caramelize, giving your potato wedges a more golden brown.
- Serve with ketchup or your favorite dipping sauce. These make wonder cheese or chili fries as well.
- Leftovers? No problem. Heat them in the air fryer for about 5 minutes for extra crispy potato wedges!
