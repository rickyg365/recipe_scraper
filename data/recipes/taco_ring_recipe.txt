A taco ring made with taco crescent rolls is a great party appetizer or a perfect snack to serve for a potluck on Super Bowl Sunday or your family game night. 

A taco crescent ring is by far one of the most popular things you can do with Pillsbury dough. It’s beefy, cheesy, and easy, and you can finish it off with your favorite taco toppings. And, did I mention that it’s fun to make? See what a Pillsbury taco ring looks like by clicking here.


Frequently Asked Questions about Taco Rings


Tips for the Cook:
- Allow the meat filling to cool a little while you are laying out the pastry dough. 
- Position the filling in an even mound surrounding the center opening – you need plenty of dough to wrap up and over it. 
- Use a small table knife or spatula or to help with tucking the dough in.
- To give the dough a lovely glossy finish, brush it with an egg beaten with a spoonful of water. Or you could use garlic butter to add a touch of flavor to the dough.
- To make sure that the dough on the bottom cooks all the way through without burning the top, the best kind of cookie sheet to use is a dark/nonstick one. It also helps to reduce the oven temperature by about 25 degrees F at the end of the recipe cooking time and cook the dough a little longer. Cover the top with foil to prevent it from browning too much. 

Another suggestion is to place your ring on the bottom shelf of your oven. Also, a cooking stone helps a lot.


What to serve with your taco crescent rolls creation

A taco-style salad is perfect for serving with your crescent ring, e.g., shredded romaine lettuce, chunks of avocado, halved cherry tomatoes, and sliced radishes. Stir some green or red spicy taco sauce into some plain ranch dressing and drizzle over the top.

How do you store the Taco Ring?

If you happen to have leftovers, store them in an airtight container for 3-5 days in the fridge. I recommend reheating them in the oven for about 15 minutes, so the crescent dough does not get mushy.


Do I have to use ground beef?

Nope! If you do not care for ground beef, substitute with ground chicken or ground turkey. You can even use one of those a non meat substitute like Beyond Beef. 


How to Make a Taco Ring
- In a large skillet, brown the ground beef until cooked through.
- Add the salt, ground black pepper, oregano, paprika, cayenne pepper, cumin, garlic powder, and water. Simmer for a few minutes.
- Remove the seasoned ground beef from the pan and combine it with the shredded cheddar cheese in a large bowl.
- Unroll the cans of crescent dough and separate all of the triangles.
- On a large baking tray or baking stone, arrange the triangles in a circle so the short ends of the triangles form the circle.
- Place the ground beef mixture onto the circle of crescent rolls.
- Fold the end of each triangle over the ground beef and press it into the dough onto the bottom layer of the crescent roll.
- Bake at 375 degrees for 20 to 25 minutes, until the crescent dough is golden brown and cooked through.
- Allow the taco ring to cool for a few minutes before serving.
