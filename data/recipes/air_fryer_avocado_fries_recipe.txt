What Makes Air Frying So Fantastic?

We all love fried foods, but we also know that deep-fat frying isn뇺 the best cooking method for our waistlines or hearts. Sure, you can bake french fries and other fried favorites in the oven and then pretend that the food taste as good as when it comes out of the regular fryer, but you know it doesn뇺! Air fryers solve the problem by using a tiny amount of oil and circulating hot air to give the food the taste, color, and texture of fried food without all the fat and calories.

Air fryers were invented in 2010 but have only become popular over the past couple of years. This recent growth of popularity is due to the availability of quality low-cost machines and the increasing number of online마ir fryer recipes마nd cookbooks. A top-of-the-line air fryer is under 200 bucks, and you can find decent models for less than a hundred. If you love fried food, and really, who doesn뇺, you probably want to add an air fryer to your kitchen arsenal.


Preparing the Avocados

Buying avocados is a bit of a gamble. You never really know what you will get. Rock hard avocado can become mushy overnight, and you can cut open one that feels perfectly ripe, only to discover it is full of black spots. Luckily, choosing avocados for making this recipe is pretty easy. The best avocado to turn into fries is slightly unripe. So, look for avocados that are firm but still dent a little when you apply some pressure.

If you want, you can use a knife to cut the avocado in half and then use a spoon to scoop out the avocado, but this method doesn뇺 always work for firmer avocados. A better way is to use a potato peeler to peel the skin off. Be careful. The skin can be slippery, and peelers are very sharp. Once you peel the skin off, then you can cut the avocado in half and remove the pit. Slice the avocado lengthwise into half-inch wide strips.
- Change up the panko bread crumb seasonings.Substitute your favorite spice mixture for the Italian seasoning and parmesan cheese. Taco seasoning or Cajun seasoning is perfect in this recipe.
- Serve with a good dipping sauce.The ideal sauce for마vocado fries말s something a little on the spicy side to balance the creaminess of the avocados.Campfire Sauce, a spicy, smoky mayonnaise-based sauce, orㅁwesome Blossom Dipping Sauce망ith its horseradish kick is ideal.
