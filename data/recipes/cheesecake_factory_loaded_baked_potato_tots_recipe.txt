How To Make Loaded Baked Potato Tots

Here are the steps for making these tasty tots:

To prep:
- Cook the bacon. You want the bacon to be extra crispy, so add two or three minutes to the stated cooking time. 
- When the bacon is nice and crisp, remove it from the oven and cool on a wire rack.
- While the bacon cools, wash the green onion and thinly slice the dark green part. Save the rest for another use. 
- Crumble the bacon into large bacon bits. 

To make the filling:

The secret to preparing great tots is not overmixing the mashed potatoes. You can save time by throwing all the ingredients for the filling into a large bowl and mixing, but the filling’s texture won’t be as nice as preparing each part of the filling separately:
- Stir together the cream cheese and grated cheddar cheese in a bowl.
- Add a beaten egg to the cheese mixture and stir to combine. 
- Place the cold potatoes in a separate mixing bowl. Sprinkle the flour, cornstarch, salt, and pepper over the top. Add the cheese mixture, bacon, and sliced green onions. 
- Use a rubber spatula to fold the other ingredients into the cooked mashed potatoes.
- Spread the potato filling onto a parchment-lined baking tray and place in the freezer until cold, about 20 minutes. 

To form the cheesy tots:
- Remove the potato filling from the freezer. 
- Use a small food scoop to portion all the cold filling into tot-sized balls. 
- Wet your hands. 
- Place a ball of filling in the palm of one hand and curl your fingers around it to gently squeeze the filling into a round shape while flattening the ends with the fingers of your other hand. 

To bread the potato tots:
- Set up a breading station with three shallow containers of flour, beaten eggs, and panko bread crumbs. 
- Place a wire rack over a rimmed baking tray at the end of the line.
- Use your right hand to coat three or four tots in flour, and drop them in the egg container. 
- Use your left hand to coat the tots with the eggs and then drop them into the container with the panko breadcrumbs.
- Switch back to your right hand to coat the tots in the bread crumbs and place them on the wire rack.
- Repeat until you bread all the tots. 

To fry:
- Fill a deep fryer or a wide, heavy-bottomed pot with at least three inches of oil. 
- Heat the oil to 350 degrees. If you are not using a deep fryer, it is worth buying a clip-on thermometer to check the temperature of the oil. 
- Once the oil is hot, carefully add a handful of tater tots to the oil. Don’t add too many, or the oil temperature will decrease, and your tots will be greasy.
- Fry the tater tots until they are golden brown, about a minute and a half, turning once. 
- Remove the tots using a frying basket or spider, and drain on a paper towel-lined baking tray. Season with salt while still warm.

If you want to freeze the tots, quick-freeze them first by putting the cooled cheesy tots on a baking tray and sticking them in the freezer for two to three hours until they are frozen solid. Then you can transfer the frozen tots to an airtight freezer-safe container. 


How to Reheat Loaded Tater Tots
