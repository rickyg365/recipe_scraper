7 Layer Dip is a real crowd-pleasing appetizer. It’s a tasty taco dip with beans, guacamole, sour cream, onion, tomato, olives, and cheese.


Seven Layer Dip is perfect for Cinco de Mayo, 4th of July, Halloween, game day, or any party.

The 80s was a decade of excess, full of big hair, outrageous fashion, and fabulous food fads. While you may not want to rock leg-warmers these days, some popular food of the time, like the 7 Layer Bean Dip, is worth resurrecting.

This recipe became a national obsession when the recipe was published as Tex-Mex Dip in Family Circle magazines (magazines, remember those?) back in 1981. It didn’t take long before you couldn’t go to a roller-rink birthday party or PTA meeting without the dip making an appearance. And why not?

It is delicious and so easy to make. Whether this easy seven layer dip recipe is nostalgia or something new, you need to give it a try.


One…Two…Three: Get Ready to Work Those Cans

Just one of the many quirks from the 80s was that although fitness workouts were front and center, nutrition and the popularity of cooking with fresh food was still on the back burner. That means you don’t have to cook a single thing to make this 7 layer dip recipe. Of course, you can make your own refried beans and avocado dip if you really want, but it’s not necessary.


Ingredients

Here’s a list of what you need:
- Frito Lay Bean Dip
- Guacamole 
- Taco seasoning mix
- Sour cream
- Green onion
- Tomatoes
- Sliced black olives
- Shredded Cheddar cheese


Own It!

Don’t like onions? Only have Monetary Jack cheese in the house? No problem, no one is making you stick to the ingredients in this recipe.

Feel free to change things up. Substitute one layer for another, skip the ones you don’t like, or add a few more. Whatever you do, it will be totally tubular.


How to Make 7 Layer Dip
- Spread bean dip in a 13 X 9-inch serving dish.
- Top with guacamole.
- Combine sour cream and taco seasoning.
- Spread sour cream mixture on top of the guacamole.
- Sprinkle chopped green onions on top.
- Sprinkle chopped tomatoes on top.
- Sprinkle sliced olives on top.
- Cover with shredded cheese.


Here are a few popular variations to the standard 7 layer dip recipe to help you out:
- Use Rotel canned tomatoes instead of cutting up fresh ones. Not only is a can easier, but you can add a lot of extra bold flavor by choosing your favorite variety. Check out the Mexican Style Diced Tomatoes with Lime Juice and Cilantro or Fire Roasted Diced Tomatoes and Green Chilies versions.
- Some like it hot. Pickled jalapeños slices make an excellent substitute for the olives for people who can’t get enough heat.
- It’s time to choose your cheese. While any shredded cheese will do, if you can get your hands on some queso fresco, using it in this dip takes it to the next level of flavor.
- There is no reason you have to stick with a Tex-Mex inspired 7 layer dip. Why not turn it into a Mediterain-style dip by layering hummus, plain yogurt, artichoke dip, shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, sliced green olives, and feta cheese? Spoon the dip onto slices of toasted Italian bread.
- A spritz of lime and a sprinkle of chopped cilantro do wonders. You would be hard-pressed to call this an additional layer, but a touch of acid from the lime and the one-of-a-kind taste of cilantro ups the taste of this dip.


Tips for Serving and Storing This Easy Seven Layer Dip Recipe
- No one likes a double-dipper. Consider making individual ramekins of 7 layer bean dip for each of your guests.
- Use a transparent serving dish. You did all that work, and it would be a shame not to let everyone see the beautiful layers.
- Serve with a hardy chip. Tortilla chips are traditional, but pita and bagel chips are even better at standing up to this hearty dip.
