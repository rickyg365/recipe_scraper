Crispy Fried Asparagus

This asparagus is covered in a crispy, cheesy batter. If you have folks that do not enjoy asparagus, this recipe is a great way to introduce them to this vegetable.

When you order this in the restaurant it’s a shareable sampler, but at home, you can turn it into a side dish.


Longhorn Steakhouse Appetizer

LongHorn Steakhouse is part of the Darden chain, which is the company that owns Olive Garden and Red Lobster. I love their themed restaurants and their attention to detail.

LongHorn Steakhouse has a wonderful, well-priced menu, and Parmesan Crusted Asparagus is one of their most popular dishes. It is likely to become your choice of appetizer to go along with their tender, well-marbled center cuts of beef.

This Parmesan Crusted Asparagus appetizer quickly became a favorite menu item of mine, and a few of you wrote to me asking for this recipe. When I get several people asking, I know it’s a fantastic find.

These asparagus spears are flash-fried with a crispy crust. They’re easy enough to prepare at home, and they make noshing on asparagus a real delight.


Ingredients Needed for Longhorn Steakhouse Parmesan Crusted Asparagus

Here’s a list of what you need:
- Fresh asparagus – Look for medium-sized spears. Thin spears won’t hold up to battering and frying..
- All-purpose flour – We’re making a batter here. We aren’t using any bread crumbs.
- Parmesan cheese – Use a mid-priced kind that you buy in the deli.
- Seasoned salt
- Buttermilk
- Oil for frying – I recommend canola or vegetable oil.


Ingredient Notes

You may want to check out this article on How to Pick Fresh Asparagus from the Kitchn. I like to pick asparagus spears of a medium thickness for this recipe.

You can also choose to use two types of Parmesan:
- Grated Parmesan. I don’t often say this, but the kind that is pre-grated works just fine for this recipe.
- Shaved Parmesan. This is an optional for the garnish because you can sprinkle grated parmesan on the finished dish. You can either get a block of Parmesan and shave off thin slices or get it already shaved.


How to Make Longhorn’s Parmesan Crusted Asparagus
- Wash the asparagus and trim off the woody ends.
- Place the flour, Parmesan, and seasoned salt in a shallow dish. Stir to combine.
- Pour the buttermilk into a separate shallow dish.
- Dredge asparagus in the flour mixture.
- Then dip them in buttermilk and dredge again in the flour.
- Place the breaded asparagus on a wire rack and allow them to rest for 5 minutes before frying.
- Pour enough oil in a cooking vessel until it is 2-inches deep. Heat oil to 350 degrees. Carefully drop a few asparagus spears in the oil at a time, and fry until golden brown. Drain the fried asparagus on a wire rack that is resting on a baking sheet.
- Garnish with grated or shaved Parmesan cheese.

How to Store Leftover Parmesan Crusted Asparagus

After the asparagus has completely cooled, store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator. It will last in the fridge for 3 to 4 days.

You can freeze the asparagus for up to 3 months in an airtight container or freezer bag.


How to Reheat Crispy Parmesan Asparagus

I recommend placing the asparagus into a 350°F air fryer and cooking for 6 to 8 minutes. You can also reheat this in the oven at 350°F for about 10 to 12 minutes.

I do not recommend microwaving the Parmesan Crusted Asparagus because it will become soggy.

I hope you give this recipe a try in one of your upcoming meals. No matter if you serve this with some shaved prime rib, a flavorful steak, or your favorite chicken, you’re going to love this way to prepare asparagus.
