How to Make Cheddar’s Spinach Dip

If you can use a knife and turn on an oven, you can make this dip. The only thing that is even a little complicated about this recipe is finding a way to squeeze out all the liquid from the thawed spinach without making a mess! Sure, you can use countless paper towels to squeeze the spinach dry, but there are better ways.

Perhaps the easiest way is to use a potato ricer. A potato ricer is a kitchen too that is great and making mash potatoes and drain spinach. Just fill the chamber of the potato rice halfway and gently squeeze over the sink. If you don’t have a potato ricer, you are not out of luck. Use a salad spinner to spin the spinach or put the spinach in a colander in the sink and press down with a plate.

However you remove the liquid from the spinach, you must get it as dry as you can. Otherwise, the dip will be much too watery.


Gussying Up the Spinach Dip

This dip is great as it is, but if you like to take things to the next level, we have you covered. Substituting the juice of a lemon and its zest for the jalapeno pepper does a fantastic job at brightening the spinach dip. Do you love artichokes? Make this a simple spinach and artichoke sip by replacing some of the spinach with an equal amount of canned artichoke hearts. Maybe you can’t get enough spice? In that case, perhaps you might want to replace some of the spinach with drained and chopped canned poblano peppers.

There are many ways to make this Cheddars Spinach Dip recipe your own, so don’t be afraid to get creative.


Tips for Making and Serving Spinach Dip
- Use a wide and shallow casserole dish. Not only will you get more of that crispy cheese layer on top that everyone loves, but it will be much easier for everyone to reach the dip.
- Bake in individual ramekins. Don’t want to share? That is alright, this some is that good. Avoid double-dipping and dip hogs by giving each person separate portions. If you are making the dip in individual ramekins, you will need to watch your timing to avoid overbaking.
- Serve on top of toasted or grilled bread. Hearty, artisanal bread is the perfect base to turn a spinach dip snack into a light meal.
