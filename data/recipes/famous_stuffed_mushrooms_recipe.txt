How do you clean mushrooms for stuffed mushrooms?

To clean mushrooms well, and actually get the dirt off of them, you will want to shower them or spray them with water. You will want to be careful not to soak them in water.

I like to place the mushrooms in a colander and just the nozzle on the sink to spray off the mushrooms.

Then, remove the mushrooms from the colander and then pat them dry.


How to keep stuffed mushrooms from getting soggy?

The ability to keep the stuffed mushrooms with cream cheese and sausage from getting soggy all goes back to the cleaning process. 

You cannot soak the mushrooms in water otherwise they will absorb too much water and then will become soggy when they are baked. 


Why are my stuffed mushrooms watery?

This is a common question when people make stuffed mushrooms with sausage. Most of it comes back to washing the mushrooms properly. 

However, you can also bake the mushrooms at a higher temperature to help dry out the mushrooms. 


Do I need to boil the mushrooms beforehand? 

You do not need to boil the mushrooms ahead of time for this recipe. This recipe needs the mushrooms to be raw in order to turn out properly.  

If you boil the mushrooms ahead of time it will actually make the sausage stuffed mushrooms extra soggy.


How long does it take to make stuffed mushrooms? 

One of the super nice things about this recipe is that you can make this homemade sausage stuffed mushrooms in less than 40 minutes.

All you need time for with this recipe is to cook the sausage and place the stuffed mushrooms in the oven for about 25 minutes.

So, if you are looking for an easy and tasty appetizer you can easily make and impress those you’re serving them to.


How to store and reheat mushrooms stuffed with sausage

When the mushrooms are done baking, and if there are any leftovers, store them in an airtight container in the fridge. They will last for about 4-5 days in the refrigerator.

Then the best way to reheat stuffed mushrooms is by placing them on a cookie sheet and baking them at 350 degrees for 15 to 20 minutes or until they are heated all the way through.
