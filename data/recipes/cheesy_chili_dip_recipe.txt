You can never have enough cheesy chili dips.  This one is different because cream cheese, cheddar cheese, and canned chili make up the base for this snack time favorite. Chili Cheese Dip is the perfect dish for the Superbowl or other special games.


Easy Party Dip

This chili cheese dip is perfect for your next tailgating party. Simple to make and it adds shredded cheddar cheese to canned chili. Cream cheese makes the dip smooth and creamy. Add your favorite tortilla chips and you have a wonderful appetizer or snack!

Chili cheese dip is the perfect appetizer to bring to your next party or get together. Who doesn’t love a good creamy and slightly spicy velveeta chili cheese dip!?          


Why Do We Love Cheese Dip?

Truly, I am not sure what about melty, dippable cheese is so appealing, but it is! You have got to make this for your next game night, movie night, or when you are watching your favorite sports game. 

It is extremely easy to make and has very minimal ingredients, but don’t let that fool you, it will not be lacking in flavor! 


What Can You Dip in Cheese Dip? 

While I would argue you can dip almost anything in cheese dip (it always makes things better), you can try a few different things with this cheese dip recipe. 

You can buy your favorite tortilla chips or make your own (it is actually pretty simple), and pair it with this scrumptious cheese dip. Make it a nacho bar to spice things up and have onions, sour cream, black olives, 

Or if you want to have an array of items to dip in chili cheese dip try pairing it with some of your favorite vegetables. 

It would be great with celery, carrots, broccoli, any bell pepper would be great! You can essentially make a vegetable platter and have this cheese dip in the center rather than the traditional ranch dip. 

Another fun item to dip in this chili cheese are those little pita breads you can get from the deli or costco. 


What Kind of Chili to Use

For this chili cheese dip recipe you are going to need chili, obviously, but what kind is best to use for this cheese dip? I suggest using a homemade chili if you can. It will have even better flavor, so if you have some stored in the freezer, now is the time to pull it out!

However, if you do not have any frozen homemade chili, nor do you feel like making some chili for this cheese dip it is not your only option. 

You can always get a can of chili and use that in place of the homemade chili. Like it said the homemade chili will have a little better flavor, but if you have a canned chili you like, that will work just fine too.  


Types of Cheese to Use for Chili Cheese Dip

There are a few different kinds of cheese you could use to make this chili dip. For this recipe I always use velveeta cheese, but if you are not a fan of velveeta there are others you can try. 

Many different restaurants when they are making queso blanco dip that is their menu they use white american cheese. Obviously, this will produce a bit lighter dip since the cheese itself is white rather than the yellow velveeta cheese. 

If you want a few other options you can try one of these 3 cheeses as well: 
- Mozzarella cheese
- Cotija cheese
- Asadero cheese

When you change the type of cheese you are using, the recipe will vary. If the dip seems to be too liquidy, you and either add in more cheese or try a little bit of cornstarch to thicken it up. 

Or, if the dip is too thick, try thinning it out with some evaporated milk, half and half, or milk. Add a little bit at a time until you get the consistency you like.

Here’s what you need to make chili cheese dip:
