The Best Fair Food

Let’s be honest for a minute, rides and games are fun and all, but it’s the food that you look forward to the most when you go to the fair. And the culinary king of the midway has to be funnel cake.

This Funnel Cake Fries recipe captures all the flavor of a classic carnival funnel cake and turns it into an easy-to-make and easily share snack that’s perfect any time.

When you can’t get your funnel cakes at the fair you can get Checker’s Funnel Cake Fries, or you may want to grab some of Burger King’s Funnel Cake Fries.


What are funnel cake fries?

Funnel cake fries are a twist on traditional Funnel Cakes. The only real difference is the shape. The batter is put into the hot oil in long strips instead of round swirls.

Unfortunately, this is one fried food you can’t make in your air fryer. But don’t let that stop you from making it. Deep frying is pretty simple once you know what you are doing.


Frying Doesn’t Have to be Scary

One of the easiest ways to fry at home is by using an electric deep fryer. You can pick one up online for less than a hundred bucks, but you can make this Funnel Cake Fries recipe without one. All you need is a heavy-bottom pot, a clip-on frying thermometer, a skimmer, and the correct type of oil.

The ideal pot is a 5- or 6-quart cast iron dutch oven. Not only do dutch ovens have heavy bottoms, but their thick sides help to distribute heat evenly.

Cast-iron retains heat wonderfully so that the oil won’t cool down as quickly. For added safety, most dutch ovens are extremely heavy and don’t have long handles, making them less likely for someone to knock over the hot oil.

The clip-on thermometer is a must for helping to maintain the correct oil temperature of 375 degrees. Frying at the proper temperature ensures that the dough cooks thoroughly without burning and prevents the dough from getting too greasy.

To fry funnel cake fries, use an oil that can withstand high heat without smoking. Probably the best neutral-tasting oil with a high smoke point is canola, but some people prefer sunflower oil’s slightly nutty flavor that matches well with sweet fried foods.

Stay safe while frying by using a long-handled skimmer to remove the cooked funnel cake fries from the hot oil.
