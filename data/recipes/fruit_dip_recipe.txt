Fruit Dip Ingredients

All this dip recipe needs is four simple ingredients.

Ingredient Substitutions

If you tend to stay away from Cool Whip because you don’t like the sound of the ingredients, try TruWhip – it has more natural-sounding ingredients.

Freshly whipped cream will not be stable enough to last very long in this recipe.

You can substitute plain Greek yogurt for sour cream.

Fruit Dip Recipe Variations

There are several flavor options you can try if you want to make your very own fruit dip recipes:
- Orange: Add 2 tablespoons of orange juice concentrate for a bright, citrusy flavor. If you are not serving this to kids, you could use 2 tablespoons of Grand Marnier. There is also non-alcoholic Grand Marnier you can get on Amazon.
- Cinnamon Honey: Beat in 2 tablespoons of honey and 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon. 
- Jello Fruit Dip: Use 3 ounces of Jello powdered mix. Fun flavor options include black cherry, cherry, fruit punch, grape, green apple, lemon-lime, mango, peach, and pineapple.
- Nutty: A spoonful of peanut butter makes for a very tasty dip for apple or pear slices.


What to Serve with Fruit Dip

Any fruit will do. Whatever is your favorite – apples, strawberries, grapes, pears, pineapple, cherries, etc.

But you don’t have to limit yourself to just fruit! Try serving your homemade dip with cubes of pound cake or even pretzels for a sweet and salty taste. This tasty dip also goes well with oreos or pecan pie.

Spread some dip on French toast and eat it with fresh strawberries for breakfast!


How to Serve Fruit with Cool Whip Dip

This is such a unique dip that it deserves to be highlighted in a gorgeous presentation with your chosen fruit.

Think about serving it, for example, on a beautiful charcuterie board. Let your presentation bring out the artist in you!


Can Fruit Dip be made ahead?

Even though you can easily throw this fruit dip together for last-minute gatherings. It’s also great if you’re planning ahead.

You can easily make this dip a day or two before you plan to serve it. Just keep it in an airtight container in the refrigerator. It will keep for up to one week.

I do not recommend freezing this dip. The texture will not be the same once it’s defrosted.


How to store leftover fruit dip

Be sure to store any leftover fruit dip in the fridge. Store in an airtight container for up to five days.  This is great to use with kiwis, any type of melon, or berries like blueberries or raspberries.
