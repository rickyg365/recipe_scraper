Tips for Making Fried Mozzarella Cheese
- Chill the cheese before battering to help ensure it doesn’t melt in during the frying.
- Paneer, Queso Blanco, or Hallumoini are also great for deep frying as they have high melting points.
- Bread cheese completely. Ensuring the cheese is well-battered is helpful so the cheese does not ooze out of the coating.
- Do not fry too many pieces at once as the oil temperature may drop too much. You should fry a few pieces at a time.

How to Store and Reheat Olive Garden Mozzarella Sticks 

The best way to store fried mozzarella sticks is in the freezer, but they will last a few days in the fridge.

There are several ways to reheat pre-cooked mozzarella sticks, but the most common way is in the oven.
- Preheat your oven to 400 degrees to reheat refrigerated mozzarella sticks, or 450 degrees, if they are frozen.
- Spread out the mozzarella sticks on a wire rack. 
- Place the wire rack onto a baking tray and put it in the oven. Bake five to 10 minutes for refrigerated mozzarella sticks and 10 to 20 minutes for frozen ones. 

Another excellent method is using an air fryer:
- Preheat the air fryer to 375 degrees.
- Spray the mozzarella sticks lightly with canola oil and put them in the air fryer, leaving space between each.
- Reheat refrigerated mozzarella sticks for five minutes and increase the time to 8 to 10 minutes if they are frozen.


Can You Freeze Homemade Mozzarella Sticks? 

Yes, you can freeze uncooked mozzarella sticks. In fact, some people always freeze mozzarella sticks before frying to prevent the cheese from melting too quickly.

To freeze uncooked mozzarella sticks:
- Spread the breaded mozzarella out in a single layer on a parchment paper-lined baking tray. 
- Put the uncovered tray in the freezer for about two hours or until they’re frozen solid.
- Transfer the mozzarella sticks to a freezer bag or container. Keep in the freezer for up to three months. 

You can use the same method to freeze cooked mozzarella sticks made using unfrozen cheese. You should never refreeze food twice. 


Should Mozzarella Sticks Be Frozen Before Frying? 

Cooks have very strong opinions about whether the proper way of making fried mozzarella sticks requires freezing them first. The majority of people seem to fall on the ‘freeze first’ side of the debate, but the truth is that it depends on the thickness of the breading.

Mozzarella sticks with a thin coating don’t need to be frozen beforehand, but if you like a thicker, crunchier exterior, an hour or two in the freezer will help stop the cheese from oozing out while frying.
