The ingredients of the delicious chili cheese dip recipe are what makes this recipe stand out the most. It is not your average taco dip recipe.  

Here are the ingredients that will be used in the recipe:

Once everything has been put in the pan, it just takes 5-7 minutes to melt everything together and serve it up with your favorite tortilla chips.


Why is the taco dip runny?

There could be a few reasons. Did you use canned chili or chili beans? Was too much sour cream added? Maybe too much salsa? 

All of these could lead to a runny dip issue. 


What can you do if the taco dip is too runny?

If the cream cheese taco dip seems to be too runny once you have everything melted down, you can do one of two things to fix it. 

You can either add more cream cheese or more shredded cheddar cheese to the pot. I would suggest only doing a little at a time because you don’t want to add too much and make it extra thick. 

Add a little bit at a time until you get the consistency you like.


Is taco dip and 7 layer dip the same thing?

No, they are not! While they both have some of the amazing taco flavors, the seven-layer dip has 7 layers and is a cold dip with shredded lettuce, black olives, refried beans, shredded lettuce, green onion, and more. Check out my recipe for 7 Layer Dip.

This dip will last for about 5-7 days when you store it in the fridge in an airtight container. Just reheat it in the microwave, give it a good stir and it is ready to serve!
