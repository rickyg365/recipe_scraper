Mastering the Mornay Sauce

The creaminess in this dish depends on the quality of the cheese sauce or more traditionally referred to as a Mornay sauce. Proper sauce-making technique means the differences between a smooth, creamy consistency and a lumpy sauce tasting of uncooked flour.
- After cooking the shrimp entirely, remove them from the pan, but leave behind any remaining liquid and aromatics.
- If there is a fair bit of liquid left pan, you can sprinkle a tablespoon of flour directly over the surface and give it a good stir. If little liquid remains in the pan, create a paste by mixing the flour with a tablespoon of water and adding it to the pan. Doing this will help prevent the flour from darkening as the raw flour flavor cooks out.
- When you start to smell an aroma like fresh bread, add half a cup of heavy cream. You can use half-and-half or even whole milk if you prefer.
- Continue to stir until the sauce thickens slightly.
- Reduce the heat to low and add the finely shredded cheese a bit at a time while continually stirring.
- When all the cheese melts, remove from heat and cover to keep warm.


Tips for Making and Serving Olive Garden Shrimp Scampi Appetizer
- Add wine and lemon juice to the pan when it is off the heat. Adding liquids with high acidity levels to a hot pan is dangerous and can cause splatter. To reduce the chance of getting burned, never add wine or lemon juice while the pan is over the heat. When you return the pan to the stove, make sure to adjust the heat to medium-low before adding the shrimp.
- Use fresh Italian bread. Cut the bread approximately a quarter-inch thick and toast until the outside crisps up. The softer bread in the center of the toast will act as a sponge to soak up any excess Mornay sauce. Garlic lovers can rub a raw garlic clove on the cut sides of the bread for more flavor.
- Select plum or grape tomatoes. You may want to include various red, yellow, and purple tomatoes for a more attractive-looking bruschetta. Scrap out all the pulp and seeds from all the tomatoes before using them in this recipe to avoid diluting the Mornay sauce.
