Why Are These Italian Rice Balls With Mozzarella So Amazing?

Honestly, it’s the whole package itself. They are filled with tasty cheese, wonderful meat choices, and are seasoned perfectly. 

One bit of these arancini di riso AKA Sicilian rice balls and you will be hooked! You should probably double the batch if you want to have any to share, they are just that good. 


So What Exactly Are Italian Rice Balls?

On the outside they are crispy, deep fried balls of rice. But, they are so much more than that. 

This arancini recipe also has a filling that has melty cheese, a marainara sauce, and plenty of seasoning and meats roll in for perfection. 

When everything is fried together, it creates the perfect bite. 


How Do You Make Rice Balls Stick Together? 

By using cold rice you will be able to get the rice to stick well together. If it needs a little encouragement you can add a tiny bit of water, about 1 tablespoon to help develop more of the natural starch in the rice. 

Then, after you have the rice formed, it will be dipped in an egg mixture which is known for keeping things together! 


Why Should You Use Risotto?

Risotto will help achieve the best results possible. By using risotto you can get the sticky kind of rice you need with this short grain, high starch rice, without getting a mushy dish. So, in the end it will make a better final dish.  


Best Way to Store Leftovers of Italian Rice Balls

If you have made the arancini recipe but do not plan to eat them all you do not have to fry them all just yet! 

After placing the fried rice balls in the fridge, move the pan to the freezer to let the balls completely freeze. Once they are completely frozen, you can then place the balls in a freezer-safe ziplock bag and keep them for the next time you want to eat this recipe for Italian rice balls. 

You can keep them in the freezer for up to 3 months! 

If you do plan to eat them within 3-4 days, feel free to keep them in an airtight container in the fridge. 


Reheating Italian Rice Balls

While you do not want to refry these arancini balls you need them to get good and hot to taste delicious but you want to try and avoid them getting soggy. 

The best way to reheat these rice balls would be to use your air fryer and heat them at 380 for 2-3 minutes. Then they should be good to go! 

If you do not have an air fryer, then the oven would be the next best option. Heat the oven to 375 and bake them for 7-10 minutes, or until they are heated all the way through.
