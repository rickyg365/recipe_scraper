What Does Queso Mean

Queso means cheese in Spanish. But cheese is not all you’re getting when you order this gooey, often spicy delight at a Tex-Mex restaurant. Queso is actually short for chile con queso which means chile with cheese in English. That’s where the spiciness comes in.

Queso is a Mexican-inspired appetizer that’s meant for dipping, but this tasty cheese sauce can also be spooned over nachos, tacos, fajitas, burritos, or grilled chicken.

Make White Queso Dip like Mexican Restaurants

We have all been to a Mexican restaurant and enjoyed delicious chips and queso. Who doesn’t love to dip a tortilla chip into a bowl of ooey-gooey queso?

The real secret here is using white American cheese as the base, you can always add in some additional Monterey Jack cheese, and some places add onions, jalapenos as well. The American cheese provides a dependable base for queso without the cheese becoming stringy or separating over time.


White Queso Ingredients

Here’s a list of what you need:
- Butter
- White onion
- White American cheese
- Canned green chilies
- Heavy cream


Make cheese dip with any type of American cheese

There’s yellow, orange, and white queso, depending on the type of cheese you use. Whatever its color, queso can be prepared with green chiles or jalapenos (or both). It may also be made a little spicier with a dash of chili powder or cumin.

While this white Mexican cheese dip is great just by itself, you may want to make it even more delicious by adding a topping of fresh pico de gallo. If you’re reheating your dip, add the pico de gallo after the reheating. If you add it before, your dip may become watery.
