Why This is the Best Recipe For Bacon Wrapped Jalapeno Poppers

No one will ever claim that jalapeno poppers wrapped in bacon are good for you, but this recipe is baked rather than deep-fried, so it is healthier than lots of versions out there.

If you have an air fryer or grill, you can even use them! Besides opting for baking, the addition of the Worcestershire sauce and the pinch of Chipotle powder really takes these to the next level.

Bacon Jalapeno Poppers are a fantastic low carb and keto-friendly appetizer and finger food. They are great for game day or anytime you want a tasty snack.


Ingredients

To make this Bacon Wrapped Jalapeno Popper recipe, you will need:
- Jalapeno peppers
- Cream cheese
- Shredded cheese
- Worcestershire sauce
- Chipotle powder
- Bacon


Ingredient Notes

Use your favorite hard cheese in this recipe. Cheddar, Pepper Jack, or a Mexican-style blend like those sold for tacos or quesadillas are all great options.

Use thinly sliced bacon for this recipe, and stay away from any wood-smoked varieties that can overpower the other flavors.


Ingredient Substitutions

Let everyone enjoy these irresistible appetizers by making them vegetarian-friendly. Use plant-based bacon, and don’t forget the vegetarian Worcestershire sauce!


How to Make This Jalapeno Poppers Wrapped in Bacon Recipe
- Cut the jalapenos in half the long way and scrape out the seeds, ribs, and the top layer of the inside flesh of the peppers to reduce the heat level.
- Pulse the cream cheese, shredded cheese, and Worcestershire sauce together in a food processor.
- Add the chipotle powder, and then buzz together. It’s best to do this step with a food processor, but if you don’t have one, you can use a blender or even just stir everything together.
- Spoon the cream cheese mixture into the jalapeno halves and wrap one slice of bacon around each jalapeno half in a spiral pattern. You can use a toothpick to prevent the bacon from coming loose.
- Put each popper on top of a wire rack over a rimmed baking sheet or on a foil-lined baking sheet.
- Place the baking sheet of prepped jalapeno poppers in the fridge for about 20 minutes to firm up the cheese mixture and allow the flavors to meld together.
- Preheat your oven to 375 degrees. You can make this recipe using an air fryer or grill as well. Check out the Recipe Variations section below to see the changes you need to make.
- Bake the poppers for about 15 minutes in the oven or until the bacon is crispy.

CopyKat Tip: When handling jalapenos, you should wear food-safe latex or nitrile gloves and always wash your hands well afterward.


Recipe Cooking Variations

This Bacon Wrapped Jalapeno Popper recipe baked in the oven is good, but you can get even more flavor when you grill them or make them in the air fryer.

To grill the poppers, prepare them in the same way as above. Preheat the grill to a moderate temperature and place the poppers on a cooler part of the grill. Turn the poppers often and cook uncovered for about 15 to 20 minutes or until the bacon is crispy.

To air fry the poppers, follow the instructions, but instead of cooking in the oven, use the air fryer. Preheat the air fryer to 325 degrees and cook the poppers for about 8 minutes, flipping them midway through the cooking time.


How to Serve Jalapeno Poppers

These are great to serve family-style on a huge platter so everyone can share. Put out a few of your favorites dipping sauces to go with the poppers. Try these:
- Sour cream is excellent for combating the heat of the peppers.
- BBQ sauce can add heat, tang, or sweetness, depending on which one you choose.
- Pineapple chutney brings the sweetness of pineapple with a bit of extra heat.
- Yogurt and dill sauce goes surprisingly well with poppers.


What Goes Well with a Jalapeno Popper Wrapped in Bacon?

Just about anything you usually serve at tailgate would go amazingly well with this recipe. And don’t forget the beer. Try pairing the poppers with a hoppy IPA!


How to Store Bacon Wrapped Jalapeno Poppers

You can keep cooked jalapeno poppers covered in the fridge for about 3 to 4 days. Note they will probably sweat and the jalapeno peppers may shrivel.


How to Freeze Jalapeno Poppers

Cream cheese tends to develop an odd consistency when frozen and then thawed, but it is possible to freeze your poppers safely for up to three months. Just make sure you cool them completely before starting the freezing process.

To freeze cooked poppers:
- Put the poppers on a baking tray in a single layer.
- Cover and freeze until entirely frozen, about 12 hours.
- Place the frozen poppers in a freezer bag to store long-term.


How to Reheat Jalapeno Poppers Wrapped in Bacon

To reheat refrigerated poppers, put them on top of a wire rack on a baking tray and bake them for about 10 minutes in a preheated 350-degree oven. Alternatively, try reheating in a preheated air fryer at 325 degrees for about 5 minutes.

To reheat frozen poppers, bake on a wire rack with a baking tray under it in a 400-degree preheated oven for about 15 minutes. Or, reheat the poppers at 325 degrees in a preheated air fryer for around 8 minutes.
