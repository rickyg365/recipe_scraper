What is a Pecan Pie Brownie?

The name of this recipe might be a little deceiving. This recipe actually has no chocolate whatsoever, whereas traditional brownie recipes usually call for chocolate in some form or another.

With this pecan pie brownies recipe you will get all of the wonderful flavors you love in a traditional pecan pie, but with the shape and texture of a brownie.


What Makes This a Brownie Rather Than a Pie?

Instead of the more liquidy base of a traditional pecan pie, the base of these pecan pie brownies includes all-purpose flour and leavening agents such as baking soda and baking powder.

This allows the mixture to become lighter and airier than a pie, but not quite as light and airy as a cake would be.

If you are still confused about why these are called both a pecan pie and a brownie, just know, it works and it is absolutely amazing. Plus, they are super easy to make! Don’t let the lengthier list of ingredients scare you.


Pecan Pie Brownie Ingredients

This recipe requires a few ingredients that you might not have at home. But, everything is super common and easy to find at your local grocery store, so you should not have a problem finding what you need.
- Pecan halves
- Dark corn syrup you can use light corn syrup if desired
- Vegetable shortening
- Dark brown sugar
- Molasses
- Chopped pecans
- Egg yolks
- Vanilla extract
- All-purpose flour
- Baking soda
- Baking powder
- Salt


How to Separate Egg Yolk From Egg White

For this recipe, you will not be using the whole egg. Rather, you just need to use the yolk of the egg. There are a few ways to do this:
- Crack the egg in half and transfer the egg yolk from one shell to the next until the egg white falls off.
- Crack the egg and gently empty it into your hand. Carefully hold on to the egg yolk while allowing the egg white to slip through your fingers.
- Use an egg separator. This handy kitchen gadget makes separating egg yolks from egg whites a breeze.

With any of these options, though, be sure not to break the yolk when separating it from the white.


How to Make Pecan Pie Brownies
- Heat oven to 350 degrees.
- Mix pecan halves with a tablespoon of dark corn syrup and set aside.
- Use a hand mixer to beat the shortening with the brown sugar until creamy.
- Add the molasses, dark corn syrup, and chopped pecans. Stir.
- Add egg yolks and vanilla. Beat to combine.
- In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
- Slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, stirring until all ingredients are well combined.
- Pour the brownie batter to an 8×8-inch square pan, that has been sprayed with cooking spray or lined with parchment paper.
- Arrange the pecan halves that have been mixed with dark corn syrup on top of the batter.
- Bake for 25 to 30 minutes at 350 degrees (or 325 degrees if using a glass baking dish).


How to Store Pecan Pie Brownies

You do not need to refrigerate these pecan pie brownies like you would a traditional pecan pie.

These can be stored at room temperature, just like any other brownies. You can either precut them and store them in an airtight container, or leave them in the baking pan and cover them with foil or the lid of the pan.


How long do pecan brownies last?

As long as the brownies are covered or wrapped up, they will last for about 5 to 7 days. After that, they will lose their freshness and become drier and harder.


Can you freeze pecan pie brownies?

Yes, you can! This recipe makes wonderful brownies that are perfect to freeze. They will keep their flavor and texture even after being frozen.

You can store them precut in an airtight container in the freezer for up to 3 months.

When you want one, just pull it out of the freezer, and let it thaw for a few hours at room temperature on the counter.

I hope you give these delicious brownies a try! They are popular around Thanksgiving, but they are so good all year long!
