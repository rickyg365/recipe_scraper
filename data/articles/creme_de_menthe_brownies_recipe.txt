So, how do you make these minty brownies? Seriously, it doesn’t get easier than this.
- If using Andes candies, chop them into pieces.

- Immediately after removing the brownies from the oven, sprinkle crème de menthe candies on top and allow them to melt.
- Swirl or spread the melted candies for a pretty design if desired.
- Cool the brownies completely before removing them from the pan and cutting them.
