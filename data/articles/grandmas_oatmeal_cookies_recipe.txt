What is it about grandmas that make them all such great bakers? I don’t know, but what I do know is that my grandmother, Ethel Eynard, made the best thin and crispy oatmeal raisin cookies I ever had. These days I love to make them myself and want to share her recipe with all of you.

What do Grandma’s Old Fashioned Oatmeal Cookies taste like?

Forget those thick and cake-like store-bought oatmeal cookies and enjoy these super-thin ones that really let the taste of roasted oats come through. The optional raisins add a burst of tartness and a bit of chewy goodness to these crunchy treats.


Why This is the Best Recipe for Grandma’s Oatmeal Cookies

These hardy homemade oatmeal cookies are ideal for dunking and make the perfect afternoon snack for your grandkids or yourself!


Ingredients for Oatmeal Cookies

To bake these homemade oatmeal cookies, you will need:
- White flour
- Brown sugar
- White sugar
- Large Egg
- Water
- Baking powder
- Vanilla extract
- Salt
- Baking soda
- Shortening or butter
- Rolled oats
- Raisins (optional)


Ingredient Notes

Most people find traditional rolled oats make the best oatmeal for these cookies, but you can use quick oats instead. Stay away from instant oatmeal because of its powdery consistency.

Fans of pinhead oats, commonly known as Irish oatmeal, can use them in this recipe, but expect an extra crunchy cookie.


Ingredient Substitutions and Variations

Grandma’s Old-Fashioned Oatmeal Cookies come out on the crisper side, but for those who like their cookies even crunchier, try making one or more of these changes to the recipe.
- Leave out the egg. Eggs steam while they cook and produce a puffier cookie.
- Replace the shortening with an equal amount of butter. Using butter lets the cookie spread out more while baking.
- Use a higher ratio of white sugar to brown sugar for a crispier, darker cookie. Try using three-quarters of a cup of white sugar and a quarter cup of brown sugar.
- Use other dried fruit instead of raisins. Although raisins are optional in this recipe, oatmeal cookies can really benefit from adding something extra to the dough. Most other dried fruits work well if you don’t want to use raisins. Dried cranberries and cherries are particularly good.
- Use chocolate chips instead of raisins. A classic combination!
- Iced Oatmeal Cookies. Everything is better with icing. A drizzle of powdered sugar icing makes these thin and crispy oatmeal cookies extra special!
- Nuts – you could add about 1/2 to 1 cup of nuts like walnuts, or pecans for additional crunch. 


What Goes Well with Thin and Crispy Oatmeal Raisin Cookies

No matter how old you are, a tall, cold glass of milk is the perfect pairing for these classic oatmeal cookies. Tea and coffee come in a close second. Here are a few suggestions:
- Brown Sugar Oatmilk Shaken Espresso
- Caramel Macchiato
- Flat White Coffee
- London Fog Tea Latte


How to Store Grandma’s Oatmeal Cookies

Moisture is the enemy of these oatmeal cookies, so if you plan on storing them for only a few days, put them in a tightly sealed container on your counter.

Freeze these cookies for up to three months. Stack them between sheets of wax paper in a freezer-safe hard-sided container with a good lid.

I hope you give this recipe a try, this is one of the best oatmeal cookie recipes I have ever tried.
