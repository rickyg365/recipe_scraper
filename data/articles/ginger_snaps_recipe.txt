What are Ginger Snaps?

If you’ve never had ginger snaps, they are cookies with a little spicy punch to them. They’re perfect for a cookie exchange or a holiday cookie tray.

These crunchy, spicy rounds with their cracked, sugary tops are equally at home dunked in tea, coffee, or milk. You can enjoy them during the November/December holiday season.

- Baking soda
- Ground ginger
- Ground cinnamon

Gingersnap Cookies Ingredient Substitutions

If you have a gluten allergy, you can use gluten-free flour. However, keep in mind that gluten-free cookies tend to be more crumbly and softer than wheat flour cookies. 


What does the molasses do for these ginger cookies?

Molasses is used in baking to add a wonderful brown sugar flavor to cakes and cookies without making them too sweet.

In these ginger snaps, the baking soda interacts with the molasses to encourage the dough to spread. This same process causes cracks in the dough to appear where moisture has escaped, creating that crunchy texture and beautiful crackled appearance.


Ginger Snaps Recipe Variations
- Roll the dough balls in granulated sugar just before baking to make the tops more crinkly and crispy. It gives them a little sparkle too.
- Tip from a reader: If you like your ginger snaps really hot, add some ground red pepper flakes to kick things up a notch.
- You can also add some freshly grated ginger for more spice and/or a pinch of cayenne pepper.
- Add chunks of candied ginger for a little gingery sweetness.
- Add cardamom. It will take your ginger snaps to a whole new level!


Tips for Making the Best Ginger Snaps
- Use granulated sugar rather than brown sugar. White sugar encourages more spread and has less moisture making for a crispier cookie.
- Make sure your spices, especially the ground ginger, are fresh and of high quality. 
- If your ginger dough balls seem very sticky, you may need to add a little more flour. Sometimes flour can be more humid than other times.
- Make sure you spread out your dough balls with plenty of space between them – they will end up “crackling” even better!
- Shorten or lengthen the cooking time for a softer or crispier cookie.


How to Serve Ginger Snaps

Eating a ginger snap while it’s still warm from the oven may be irresistible – ginger snap heaven! Here are some other ways to use your ginger snaps:
- Serve these ginger snap cookies on a holiday dessert table with other Christmas cookies.
- If you want to stay with a ginger theme, you could also pair them with an easy gingerbread cake.
- These cookies would also make a great base for ice cream sandwiches.
- Another idea is to use these cookies in place of graham crackers for over-the-top s’mores!
- Use them to make a pumpkin pie crust or with pumpkin custard.


What Goes Well With Ginger Snaps?

Of course, ginger snaps are marvelous on their own, with a glass of milk, or a cup of coffee or tea.

You may never have thought of combining a ginger snap with a dip. However, these ginger cookies are fabulous when dipped in Sharon’s Pumpkin Pie Dip for ginger snaps. Her dip is flavorful and almost like a pumpkin cheesecake without the work. You’re sure to love it!


How to Store Homemade Ginger Snaps

Keep your ginger snap cookies fresh and crisp in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 7 days. You can also store them in your freezer for up to 1 month.


How to Freeze Ginger Snap Cookie Dough

Think about baking a half batch of cookies and then freezing the dough balls of the second half for later. A freezer full of cookie dough is a joyful sight!

Place your cookie dough balls on a baking sheet and freeze until solid. Then place them in an airtight container and store in the freezer.

You can bake from frozen, reducing the temperature to 325°F and adding a couple of minutes to the baking time.

CopyKat Tip: Freeze cookie dough balls on a paper plate and then slide the plate into a gallon size freezer zip-top plastic bag.
