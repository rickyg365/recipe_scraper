Hot Fudge Sundae Cake

When I was growing up, I would spend large parts of my summer in Jefferson City, Missouri. My grandparents loved eating at Shoney’s and I did too. They had two dessert items you had to try. One was the Strawberry Pie and the other must-try dessert was the Hot Fudge Cake.

Who doesn’t remember this glorious dessert from Shoney’s Big Boy (or Bob’s Big Boy)? The iconic hot fudge cake was many a suburban kid’s birthday dessert. It’s a retro vibe and the irresistible combination of moist devil’s food cake, creamy vanilla ice cream, thick and rich hot fudge sauce, billowy whipped cream, and cherry on top is not to be missed, even if you’ve never tried it before.

And don’t forget National FREE Hot Fudge Cake Day at Shoney’s! Last year, it was December 6th, so keep your eye on the calendar for when you can enjoy this treat free. Until then, make and enjoy this copycat version whenever the mood strikes!

Why Do You Want To Try This Recipe for This Hot Fudge Cake?

The thought of making a homemade ice cream cake may seem a bit overwhelming at first, but even if you don’t ordinarily make such fancy desserts, don’t skip this Hot Fudge Cake recipe.

It is easier to put together than it seems, and it’s so worth it. Serve this cake for any occasion or just as a special treat.


Hot Fudge Cake Recipe Ingredients

To make the cake, you’ll need:
- Devil’s Food Cake Mix
- Eggs
- Chocolate syrup
- Water
- Vegetable oil
- Vanilla paste or extract
- Kosher salt
- Vanilla ice cream

To make the hot fudge sauce, you’ll need:
- Sweetened condensed milk
- Bittersweet chocolate
- Water
- Syrup or dark corn syrup
- Salt
- Vanilla paste or extract

Garnish the cake with:
- Whipped cream

Ingredient Notes

To save time, make the cake and use premade hot fudge sauce. Just be sure you get a good-quality fudge sauce that contains real cream and butter, like Herrell’s Original Hot Fudge Sauce.

There is no need to buy fancy vanilla ice cream for this recipe, but you need to get a brand that comes in a rectangular brick container. This will make cutting the ice cream into slices much easier. 


How To Make Hot Fudge Cake

Breaking this recipe down into two separate procedures makes it more manageable. You can make the cake days before you serve it, but the hot fudge sauce is best when it is fresh. 
- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
- Oil the inside of a 9 X 13-inch metal cake pan with straight sides. 
- Line the bottom of the pan with oiled parchment paper. 
- Combine the cake mix, eggs, chocolate syrup, water, oil, vanilla extract, and salt in a large bowl. 
- Mix at low with a hand or stand mixer for 30 seconds. Stop the mixer and scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Increase the speed to medium and mix for two minutes. 
- Pour the batter into the cake pan and smooth.
- Bake until the top of the cake is springy, 22 to 25 minutes. 
- Let the cake cool slightly to release the sides. Run a butter knife along the edges and turn the cake onto a cooling rack. 
- Once the cake cools, cut the cake into two 6.5 x 9-inch pieces. Wrap one half and save for another use. 
- Use a serrated knife to level the top of the remaining cake. Then cut the cake in half horizontally. 
- Put two long overlapping sheets of plastic wrap on your work surface and lay the bottom half of the cake on top.
- Slice the brick of ice cream into enough 3/4 inch slices to cover the bottom half of the cake. Trim off any overlapping ice cream, and cover with the top half of the cake. 
- Wrap the cake tightly in plastic wrap and put it in the freezer for at least two hours or solid. 

To make the homemade hot fudge sauce:
- Combine the sweetened condensed milk, bittersweet chocolate, water, corn syrup, and salt in a small saucepan over medium heat. 
- Stir continuously until the chocolate melts. 
- Remove the saucepan from the heat, stir in the vanilla, and cover to keep warm. 


Recipe Note

This recipe only uses half the sheet cake, so either make 2 hot fudge cakes to use all the cake or save the other half for another use. Regardless, it will be easier to assemble the cake if you work with half at a time.

If you decide to make the whole cake into fudge cake, you will have enough fudge sauce for all the slices, but you will need to get 2 containers of ice cream, of which you will probably use about 1 1/2 of it.


Best Ways To Serve Hot Chocolate Fudge Cake

Maintaining the contrast in temperatures between the hot fudge sauce and the cold ice cream is essential for the best eating experience. Shoney’s traditionally garnishes the cake with whipped cream and a maraschino cherry, but you can add crushed nuts, chocolate chips, or Reeses Pieces. 


Storing Hot Fudge Sundae Cake

Keep this cake in the freezer for up to a month, covered in plastic wrap. Put the cake inside a hard-sided container to prevent it from being crushed. 

You can store the hot fudge sauce for 4 to 5 days in the fridge. Reheat the hot fudge on the stove in a small saucepan over low heat. Remember to throw away any reheated leftover hot fudge sauce. 


Hot Fudge Cake Sundae FAQ

The main difference between these two types of cake is the texture. A chocolate cake is light with a delicate crumb and small air pockets. On the other hand, a chocolate fudge cake has a thick, dense texture, more like a slightly unbaked brownie. Adding the chocolate sauce to the cake batter makes this hot fudge cake extra deliciously gooey.

Authentic hot fudge sauce is thick and rich because it contains dairy, while the base for chocolate sauce uses water or corn syrup. Hot fudge sauce may also have other flavorings, such as vanilla, missing from chocolate sauce.

Many national brands that advertise themselves as fudge sauce don’t contain real cream or butter, so try to purchase a fudge sauce that does, like, Herrell’s Original Hot Fudge Sauce.

A slice of the cake served at the restaurant has 620 calories — 210 come from fat.
