Chess Pie with Nuts and Raisins

Chess pie is a pie that simply isn’t made enough. If you haven’t tried it, you don’t know what you’ve been missing.

This old-fashioned chess pie recipe from the archives of my grandmother is filled with raisins, nuts, and so much more. This is a nostalgic pie – simple, sweet, and satisfying.


What Is Chess Pie?

Chess Pie has a long history. It’s been around since the 1700s, so there’s been plenty of time for variations.

The basic pie comprises flour, sugar, butter, and eggs… and maybe some cornmeal or a few chopped pecans.

This easy chess pie recipe is a creamy chess pie without cornmeal that uses nuts, raisins, and spices. It’s a wonderful pie for any festive occasion and makes a great alternative to pecan pie for your Thanksgiving feast.

The origin of the name chess pie is nebulous and undefined.

Some people insist that at some point in history when asked what kind of pie was being served, a waitress answered, jes’ pie (with a southern accent!).

Another explanation replaces the waitress with a plantation cook who coined the name chess pie because chestnut meal was once used in place of cornmeal.

Yet another idea is that the pies were stored in pie chests (maybe pronounced chess!). 

Take your pick! If you want to, you can take a deeper dive into the origin of the name for chess pie.
