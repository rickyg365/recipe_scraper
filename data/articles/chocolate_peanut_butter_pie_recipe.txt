Pies are my favorite dessert and this chocolate peanut butter pie is at the top of my list. This chocolate and peanut butter pie has all of the flavors you love in one rich dessert, and pairs beautifully with a creamy espresso coffee.


Why this is the Best Recipe for Chocolate Peanut Butter Cream Pie

Most chocolate peanut butter pies have you use a prepared pie crust, which can work but it does lack some flavor from the butter you use with this recipe.

It is also more than just a peanut butter and cream cheese base. When you add in the heavy cream and brown sugar, it brings the taste of this pie to the next level.


Is this a no bake chocolate peanut butter pie recipe?

The pie filling itself is a no bake pie, however, if you are making the recipe as it is written, you will have to bake the pie crust before it is used to hold the pie filling.

But, if you would like to make this into a no bake pie, you can purchase a premade graham cracker or chocolate pie crust at the grocery store and use that in place of the homemade pie crust with the recipe.

When using a premade crust, you will not need the graham cracker crumbs or the butter as listed in the ingredients.

Ways to Top Chocolate Peanut Butter Pie

The nice thing about this pie is that you can make it super simple or fancy, whichever you’d like!
- If you are looking for a simpler option, leave it with just the melted chocolate ganache poured over the top.
- You can also add either a layer of whipped cream on top, or drizzle melted peanut butter on top., or you may want to top this with a dollop of Cool Whip.
- Sprinkle chopped peanuts on top of the pie.
- Go extra fancy and do all three and you will have a truly luscious peanut butter chocolate pie.


Why is my chocolate peanut butter pie runny?

There could be a couple of different reasons:
- If your cream cheese was too soft it can make the pie softer and harder to set up.
- If you add too much of the heavy cream you can get a runny pie. Offset this by adding in more peanut butter to thicken it up.

Then make sure to place the peanut butter mixture in the fridge to let the pie filling set up a bit.
