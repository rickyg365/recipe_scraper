Variations for Pineapple Cherry Dump Cake

Instead of using pre-made cherry pie filling, you are always able to use your own homemade fresh or canned cherry pie filling. This would also taste good with strawberry pie filling as well!

If you aren’t a fan of pecans, try using walnuts instead, or just leave the nuts off completely.

White cake mix can be used in place of yellow cake mix as well if needed, but it might change the taste ever so slightly.

You can even make up a sweet cherry syrup or white chocolate sauce to serve with this or even drizzle over top of the cake along with the nuts.
