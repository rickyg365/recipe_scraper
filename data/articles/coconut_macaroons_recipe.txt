Coconut Macaroons Ingredients

This recipe only requires a short list of ingredients, but if you do have to make a quick trip to the store, these macaroons are 100% worth it. The sweet creamy coconut flavor of these cookies is unmatched. Here’s a list of what you need:
- Sweetened condensed milk
- Shredded coconut
- Vanilla Extract
- Almond Extract

If you don’t have almond extract, you can replace it with vanilla extract. However, having the two extracts adds to the amazon flavor of these macaroons.


How to Make Coconut Macaroons
- Place all of the ingredients in a large mixing bowl.
- Stir until thoroughly combined.
- Drop the mixture by tablespoonfuls (you may want to use a cookie scoop) onto a prepared baking sheet or a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. 
- Bake at 350°F until the edges are golden brown, about 8 to 10 minutes.


Recipe Variations

This is such a good recipe as it is, however you can change it up a little bit if you want. Try making them with nuts or chocolate chips.

Nut Macaroons: substitute 1 cup of chopped nuts for 1 cup coconut. You’ll need to bake them a little longer, about 10 to 12 minutes.

Chocolate Chip Macaroons: Replace half a cup of the shredded coconut with mini chocolate chips for even more added sweetness. Adding in the chocolate makes this an even more indulgent cookie!


How Do You Keep Coconut Macaroons From Spreading When Cooking Them?

When you are making coconut macaroons, there are a few things to consider in order to keep them from spreading.

Do not overwork the cookies. When they are handled a lot, the condensed milk begins to warm up making it less viscous and less capable of binding the cookies together.

Make sure to press the cookies together well. Since you are working with coconut as the main base of the cookie, these macaroons will be more fragile than your average cookie. Do your best to make a compact ball out of the coconut so it will hold together.

You may need to refrigerate the cookie mixture. If the first batch of cookies spreads out, refrigerate the coconut mixture for at least 15 to 20 minutes before making another batch. If the cookies are too warm, they will more easily spread out, whereas if the cookies are cold when they go in the oven, they will stick together better.


How Do You Keep Coconut Macaroons Crispy?

To start with, you should make sure the coconut macaroons get a light browning in the oven. This is what adds a nice crunch to the macaroons.

Then, store your cookies properly so they don’t obtain too much moisture, which could cause them to get soft or stale.


How to Store Coconut Macaroons

To keep these cookies crispy and delicious, store them in an airtight container in a dry place. They will stay fresh for up to a week.

You can also individually wrap them in plastic wrap before placing them in an airtight container to help them stay crispy longer.
