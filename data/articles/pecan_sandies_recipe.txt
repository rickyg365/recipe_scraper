Pecan Sandies History

Pecan sandies are thought to originate from the sweet treats found in medieval Arab cuisine. The name sandies may have been inspired by the sand-like color of the finished product.

The Keebler Company owns the brand name Sandies, which is used on its line of shortbread cookies.


What Is a Pecan Sandie?

Think shortbread plus crunchy pecans. In a nutshell, a melt-in-your-mouth cookie (pun intended!).

Pecan sandies are tasty treats that are a shortbread cookie bursting with the aroma of real butter, stuffed with roasted pecans, and then dusted with powdered sugar. They’re called sandies because of their crumbly shortbread texture. 


Why This is the Best Recipe for Pecan Sandies

This is a tried and true recipe. We have been making this exact pecan sandies recipe in our family for over 60 years. It was passed from my grandmother to my mother and these are the cookies that I grew up enjoying during the holidays.

These cookies are easy to make and require very little from your pantry. And, it’s the butter that makes this recipe for pecan sandies so good.

Sandies have a wonderful nutty flavor from the pecans that toast while you cook the cookies in the oven. After removing them from the oven, you roll them in powdered sugar.

The powdered sugar almost makes its own frosting because, in a day or so, much of the powdered sugar has formed a lovely little crust. These homemade pecan sandies are way better than their store-bought cookie counterparts.

Pro Tips for Making Pecan Sandies
- Use pre-chopped pecans, which tend to be a bit less expensive and also save you a step.
- Measure your flour correctly. Adding too much flour to this pecan sandies cookies recipe is a common mistake.
- Chill the dough. The dough for these pecan sandies is easier to work with when chilled.
- When making balls, the dough might be a bit crumbly, so take time to press it together well so that the cookies hold their shape.
- When hand-working cookie dough, it helps to keep the palms of your hands slightly damp with a bit of water or oil. This prevents the cookie dough from clinging to your palms.
- Line your ungreased baking sheets with parchment paper. 
- Switching racks and rotating your baking sheet halfway through baking will allow your cookies to cook as evenly as possible. Every oven is different, and many have hot spots. 


How to Soften Butter Quickly

Has this happened to you? You get yourself all pumped up to start baking, only to realize you forgot to take the butter out of the fridge ahead of time.

To speed along the softening process, cut the butter into small chunks to increase the surface area. Another idea is to place your butter between two sheets of waxed paper and roll it with a rolling pin into a thin sheet.

Microwaving a cold stick of butter is tricky. Best case scenario: your butter ever-so-annoyingly melts a little bit. Worst case scenario: it explodes! If you decide to risk it, use low power and check the butter every 20 seconds. 


What Goes Well With Pecan Sandies

No holiday cookie platter should be without these buttery and nutty pecan sandies. They may not seem to stand out next to chocolatey cookies or those fabulously decorated cookies, but they are sneaky good in the taste department.

These crispy cookies are not overly sweet. These melt-in-your-mouth treats are great for dunking in a cold glass of milk. And, they go really well with a cup of hot tea or coffee or a steaming mug of hot chocolate.


How to Store Pecan Sandies

Store your pecan cookies in an airtight container on the kitchen counter for up to one week. You can freeze baked cookies for up to 3 months.


Make-Ahead Pecan Sandies Recipe

The cookie dough can be formed into a roll, chilled for a few days, and then sliced for baking as needed.

You can freeze the unbaked dough for up to 3 months. Make the dough balls, scoop them onto parchment paper, and freeze.

Once frozen, put the dough balls in freezer bags and pull out a dozen or so to bake when needed. They will be thawed enough by the time the oven preheats. It makes baking for the holidays real easy.
