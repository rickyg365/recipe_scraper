What’s the Difference Between the Shamrock McFlurry and a Shamrock Shake?

The Shamrock Shake is a drink made with creamy vanilla ice cream, blended with an unmistakable minty flavor, and topped with a whipped topping. It was first introduced nationally in 1970 by Connecticut McDonald’s owner and operator Hal Rosen.

He initially created the mint shake in celebration of St. Patrick’s Day, but sales from the drink took off and were used to construct the very first Ronald McDonald House to help families stay close during difficult times.

The Oreo Shamrock McFlurry is an ice cream treat. It appeared on the scene in 2020. This dessert in a cup is thicker than the Shamrock Shake and includes Oreo cookie pieces blended throughout.
