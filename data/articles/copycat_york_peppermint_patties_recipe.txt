York Peppermint Patties History

In the 1920s, Henry C. Kessler founded the York Cone Company in York, Pennsylvania. It should come as no surprise that they made ice cream cones.

However, in 1940, Kessler decided to create a firm, crisp peppermint candy, that would be quite different from the “gummy” peppermint candies that were then being sucked on. In fact, each pattie was tested for crispness:

“It was a snap test. If the candy didn’t break clean in the middle, it was a second.”

Scrumptious York Peppermint Patties became so popular that the York Cone Company soon gave up making ice cream cones altogether. The current incarnation of York mints is made by Hershey. It’s not quite as crisp as the original, but it’s just as tasty. The Hershey company has done well to carry on this iconic candy.  I know you are going to love this homemade peppermint patty recipe. 


York Peppermint Patty Ingredients

Here’s a list of what you need:
- Powdered sugar – gives the candy its sweetness, this sugar is also known as confectioner sugar
- Corn syrup – adds a smooth texture to the patties, if you don’t want to use corn syrup some grocery stores sell Golden Cane Syrup which is made out of sugar cane.
- Butter – adds a nice flavor and helps to make the sugar bind very nicely together.
- Peppermint extract – for the classy mint flavor
- Dark chocolate – to coat the patties, if you desire you could use milk chocolate, instead of the dark chocolate
- Vegetable shortening – for a lovely glossy chocolate coating.


What is the Best Kind of Sugar to Use?

I personally use sugar made from sugar cane. Not all sugar is made from sugar cane, some of it is made with sugar beets. Cooks Illustrated states that sugar made from sugar cane has more flavor and it is better to use when making sugar cookies and candy.


How to Make York Peppermint Patties
- Sift the powdered sugar.
- In a medium-sized bowl, add powdered sugar, corn syrup, butter, and peppermint extract.
- Blend with a mixer until smooth.
- Portion the mint mixture into bite-sized balls of dough.
- Refrigerate the balls for 20 minutes.
- With the bottom of a glass, press the balls into patties.
- In a double boiler, melt the chocolate and shortening.
- Drop the peppermint patties into the melted chocolate.
- Flip the peppermint pattie over to coat on all sides with a fork. Shake off excess chocolate. 
- Place the dipped peppermint patties on either a silicone mat, parchment paper,  or waxed paper to dry.

You can top with sprinkles if desired.

Recipe Notes

Sift the sugar to make sure it is light and fluffy before blending it with butter, peppermint extract, and corn syrup.

After blending this together, portion the mint candy into bite-sized pieces rolled into balls. Refrigerate the balls while melting the chocolate.

Melt the chocolate in a double boiler on the stove. Make sure the water in the double boiler is only at a simmer. You do not want the steam or water drops to get into the chocolate. If it does, your chocolate will seize and not be smooth. You can melt the chocolate in the microwave. Place all chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl, and heat the chocolate for 30 seconds, remove the chocolate stir, and repeat until all of the chocolate has melted. 


How to store this homemade peppermint patty recipe

To enjoy these bite-size sweets be sure to place them in an airtight container. I recommend storing them in the refrigerator.  Do not place the finished candies in the freezer, the chocolate may discolor, and not look as pretty. 

I hope you give this recipe a try. These mighty candies are a rich snack that is perfect for any special occasion, easter baskets, work celebrations, Christmas stockings, Halloween candy bowls or even Valentine’s day gift bags.
