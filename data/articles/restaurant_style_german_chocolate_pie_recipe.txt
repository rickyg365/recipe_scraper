German Chocolate History

Oddly enough, the name of this pudding and nut pie owes its origins, not to Germany, but to Samuel German of the Baker’s Chocolate Company headquartered outside of Boston, Massachusetts.

In the mid-1800s, Mr. German developed dark baking chocolate that gives this pie, and the more famous German Chocolate Cake, its characteristic color and flavor.

If you consider yourself a chocolate person and have never tried a German Chocolate Pie before, you don’t know what you are missing.


What Makes a German Chocolate Pie So Good

The flavor combination of rich semisweet dark chocolate, shredded coconut, and nuts can’t be beaten. It’s one of the best holiday pie recipes you can bake because you can easily find all the ingredients during the winter months when fresh fruit is out of season.


What Makes This the Best German Chocolate Pie Recipe

There are many versions of German Chocolate Pies out there, and most of them are good pies, but this recipe is much simpler while still managing to taste amazing.

The addition of the meringue topping, although not traditional, makes this coconut pecan German chocolate pie extra special and one of the best pies to make for potlucks and other gatherings.


German Chocolate Pie Recipe Ingredients

To make this German Chocolate Pie recipe, you will need:
- 9-inch pastry pie shell
- Semisweet chocolate chips
- Dark chocolate pudding mix (cooking, not instant)
- Whole milk for the pudding
- Shredded coconut
- Chopped pecans or walnuts
- Whipped cream or Cool Whip topping

If you are opting for a meringue topping instead of whipped cream, you will also need:
- Egg whites
- Vanilla extract
- Cream of tartar
- Sugar


Ingredient Substitutions

While there are only a few ingredients in this recipe, you can make a couple of tweaks to make this German Chocolate Pie recipe standout.
- Try swapping out the pastry crust for a pecan pie crust to increase the nut factor.
- Make your own whipped cream instead of buying it from the store for a slightly healthier and better-tasting option.

CopyKat Tip: For a restaurant effect, use a cake decorating bag with a tip to pipe the whipped topping on the pie.

The meringue topping is a bit of extra work, but once you taste it, you’ll know it was well worth the effort:
- Use a stand mixer or a whisk to beat the egg whites, vanilla, and cream of tartar until soft peaks form.
- Add the sugar slowly and continue to beat the egg whites until they reach stiff, glossy peaks and the sugar dissolves. Be careful not to overwhip.
- Use a spatula to spread the meringue over the warm pudding.
- Bake the pie at 350°F for 12 to 15 minutes, or until the meringue is golden brown.
- Let the pie cool on a wire rack, then chill in the fridge.
- Once cold, sprinkle the remaining chocolate chips, coconut, and nuts on top and serve.


How to Serve German Chocolate Pie

Good pies don’t need much. Just slice and serve with a tall glass of cold milk or maybe a cup of coffee.


How to Store Leftover German Chocolate Pie

Pies with pudding don’t do too well in the freezer, but you can keep this pie in the fridge for 3 to 4 days.

To prevent the pie from drying out, cover well with loose plastic wrap or, better yet, put in a pie keeper.
