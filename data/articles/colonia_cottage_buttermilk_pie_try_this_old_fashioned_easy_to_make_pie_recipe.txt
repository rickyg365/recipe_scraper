How To Make Buttermilk Pie

Here are the simple steps for making a buttermilk pie:
- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
- In a large bowl, whisk the eggs until they become foamy and lighten in color slightly.
- Add in the sugar and whisk to combine.  
- In a separate bowl, combine the melted butter, salt, buttermilk, and vanilla extract.
-  Add the butter mixture to the eggs.
- Whisk in the flour and continue mixing until smooth.
- Pour the filling into the unbaked pie crust.
- Sprinkle the nutmeg on top.

Best Buttermilk Pie Recipe Tips
- Let all the ingredients come up to room temperature before cooking for the best results. 
- Using a stand mixer with a balloon whisk attachment saves a lot of arm pain. 
- Finding the perfect time to take a buttermilk pie out of the oven can be tricky. The edge of the filling near the crust should be firm, but the filling needs to be set in the center but still a little jiggly.  


Buttermilk Pie Recipe Easy Troubleshooting

Custard pies are not challenging to make, but they have their own set of unique filling issues that can pop up. 

Weeping is a common problem when making any type of custard pie. It is caused by cooking the pie at either too high of a temperature or for too long. 

Since many built-in thermometers on ovens are faulty, it is always good to use a separate oven thermometer to double-check. Another good trick is warming up your crust in the oven for a few minutes before pouring in the filling.

Loose custard will ruin a good buttermilk pie, and the culprit is usually taking the pie out of the oven too soon. The times in the recipe are just a guide.

Many factors like the size of the eggs you use or even the weather can significantly affect when the custard sets.

It is also important to remember that the custard will continue to cook when you take it out of the oven and will thicken as it cools, so you don’t want to keep the pie in the oven too long. 

Knowing exactly when to take out a buttermilk pie from the oven is a skill that will only come with practice. 


Buttermilk Pie Storage

Allow the buttermilk pie to cool on a wire rack and serve warm. If there are any leftovers, go ahead and let the pie come down to room temperature.

Cover the buttermilk pie loosely with plastic wrap or put it in a pie keeper and place it in the fridge. 


How Long Will Buttermilk Pie Last?

A buttermilk pie will keep for up to five days in the fridge.
