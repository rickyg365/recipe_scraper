You can find everything you will need to make this wonderful tiramisu cheesecake recipe at your local grocery store. Here’s a list of what you need:

Can I forego the brandy and/or coffee in this recipe for tiramisu cheesecake?

To get the full flavor and effect of a tiramisu cheesecake, you should use both the brandy and the coffee. However, there are substitutions if you do not care for either of them.


Ingredient Substitutions

You can substitute the brandy with Marsala wine, dark rum, or cognac.

When you take away the coffee from the dish you are removing half of the flavors of a classic tiramisu cheesecake. If you are worried about the caffeine in the dish, use decaf coffee.

If you simply cannot use coffee for this recipe, I would suggest trying to use warm hot cocoa instead. You will not get the notes of coffee, but will still get a good chocolate flavor.

You can substitute ladyfingers with biscotti or vanilla wafers.


How to Make Tiramisu Cheesecake
- Place cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla in a mixing bowl.
- Using an electric mixer at medium speed, beat until well blended.
- Add eggs one at a time until well blended.
- Add brandy and stir or mix at low speed to combine.
- Arrange ladyfingers on the bottom and sides of a 9-inch pie plate.
- Drizzle coffee over the ladyfingers.
- Spread the cream cheese mixture over the ladyfingers.
- Bake at 350 degrees for approximately 1 hour.
- Cool the cheesecake to room temperature then refrigerate it for at least 3 hours or overnight.
- Garnish with Cool Whip topping before serving.


Other Tips, Tricks, and Substitutions for the Best Tiramisu Cheesecake

Do not put too much coffee in the dessert. You want to get the taste of coffee in the dessert by having the ladyfingers absorb some of the liquid. But, if there is too much liquid then you are left with a soggy mess.

For non-alcoholic tiramisu cheesecake, substitute the brandy with coffee or melted butter.

You need to be patient. Give this dessert the time it needs to set up and soak up all of those glorious coffee flavors. I promise you won’t regret it!


Can I make this tiramisu cheesecake recipe ahead of time?

Yes! This tiramisu cheese cake most definitely benefits from the added time. So feel free to make it a day or so in advance. This cheesecake can last for 4 to 5 days in the fridge.


How to Store Tiramisu Cheesecake

Cover the cheesecake with plastic wrap or place it in a pie container. Keep the cheesecake refrigerated when not serving.


Can I freeze tiramisu cheesecake?

You can freeze this recipe. I would suggest taking the time to individually wrap the pieces in plastic wrap and then in aluminum foil.

Or if you want to freeze the whole cheesecake, make sure it is in a freezer-safe pan and then wrap it in plastic wrap and aluminum foil. It will last for up to 4 months in the freezer.
