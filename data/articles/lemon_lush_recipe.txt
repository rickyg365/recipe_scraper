How to Make Lemon Lush

Making Lemon Lush dessert is very simple, but breaking the process into three sections makes it even easier. Feel free to prepare the crust up to a day before filling and keep it covered in the fridge. 

To make the crust:
- Preheat the oven to 350°F. 
- Place the nuts in a plastic bag and use a rolling pin to crush them into small pieces.
- Melt the butter in the microwave or a saucepan over low heat.
- Stir in the melted butter, crushed nuts, and flour until it resembles wet sand.
- Press the mixture evenly onto the bottom of a lightly greased 9×13-inch baking pan with your fingertips. 
- Blind bake the crust until it is lightly brown, about 15 minutes.
- Allow the crust to cool completely before filling. 

To make the pudding layer:
- Combine both packets of pudding mix with the milk in a mixing bowl.
- Mix until the pudding begins to thicken, about 3 to 5 minutes. Don’t worry if the consistency of the filling is a little thick – that is what you want. 
- Scoop the pudding onto the cold crust carefully. 
- Use an offset spatula to even out the filling. Don’t leave any spaces around the sides of the pan. 
- Place the pan in the fridge while you make the cream cheese layer. 

To make the cream cheese layer:
- Soften the cream cheese by leaving it on the counter for about 30 minutes. 
- Combine the softened cream cheese, whipped topping, and powdered sugar in a bowl with an electric mixer.
- Use a hand or stand mixer to beat the mixture until it increases in volume and becomes light and fluffy. 
- Scoop the cream cheese mixture onto the pudding layer and smooth with an offset spatula be sure to spread in an even layer. 
- Refrigerate the dessert until serving.

How Long Do You Need to Chill Lemon Lush Before Serving

How Do You Cut Lemon Lush Dessert

To cut, run a butter knife around the inside edges of the pan to loosen the sides. Slice the Lemon Lush into 3X3-inch squares using the point of a knife. 


What To Serve With Lemon Lush Pie

Try garnishing a slice of Lemon Lush pie with fresh, dried, or macerated fruit. A dollop of lemon curd and citrus zest are two ways you can add a bit more tartness to the dessert.

Sprinkle crushed nuts or sugar cookies on top for an extra layer of crunch. 


How To Store Lemon Lush Delight

Always keep the wrapped pie in the fridge. The Lemon Lush recipe will keep for up to three days this way, but it is a good idea to finish it within a day or two since the crust can get a bit soggy.
