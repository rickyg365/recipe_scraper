Hamentashen Cookies

This Hamentashen cookies recipe is for a very deliciously filled triangle cookie that is also very symbolic in Jewish culture. It is a delicate cookie but is actually a very simple recipe to prepare.


The History of Hamentashen

This recipe for hamantaschen is generally made in the springtime to celebrate the Jewish holiday of Purim. The hamantaschen cookies themselves were known to be named after a villain named Haman in the Purim story in the Book of Esther.

They are also supposed to be a symbol for Haman’s ears as they were cut off after being defeated.

While the name of the cookies comes from a not-so-sweet man, these are definitely a sweet treat and a good reminder from when the enemy of the Jewish people was defeated.


Why This is the Best Recipe for Hamentashen

Not only will you get great instruction on how to make these triangle cookies, but this is also the best Hamentashen recipe because it is super simple and made all in one bowl.

No need to dirty extra dishes when you can make the dough for these Hamentashen cookies in a large mixing bowl.


Why is this Recipe Different?

One of the things people love about this recipe is that since it is made without dairy, it is considered to be made parve. Which is perfect for when you are observing specific Jewish dietary restrictions.

Also even though this recipe is made with oil instead of butter, it does not lose the flavor, rather people love the flavor and consistency of the Hamentashen cookies.


Recipe Ingredients

There are no crazy ingredients needed for this Hamentashen recipe. Take a look to make sure you have everything in stock in your pantry, and you will be good to go!
- Large eggs
- Vegetable oil (by using oil the recipe is considered to be parve)
- Sugar
- Vanilla extract
- Baking powder
- Salt
- All-Purpose flour
- Filling of your choice like fruit preserves, nuts, or non-dairy chocolate chips, or even canned poppy seed filling


Ingredient Substitutions

While I use vegetable oil to keep the recipe pareve, you can always try using coconut oil or even olive oil in its place and still continue to keep the recipe parve. Though, if you do change the oil used, there is a chance it could change the flavor slightly.

Or if that is not a necessity to you, you can try and substitute the oil with butter as other recipes do use that as well.

Instead of using all-purpose flour, you could try using coconut flour or another gluten-free flour of your choosing to help these cookies fit more appropriately into any dietary restrictions.


How To Make Hamentashen
- Begin by preheating the oven to 350 degrees.
- Using a large mixing bowl mix together 3 eggs, sugar, oil, and vanilla extract until it is smooth and creamy.
- Next sift together the flour, salt, and baking soda. (Do NOT skip this step!)
- Then add the dry ingredients into the sugar mixture and blend it together until the dough comes together. The dough will be a little sticky. If your dough is crumbly, add a little more oil or some egg. If it is too sticky, add a little bit more flour (1 to 2 tablespoons).
- Knead the dough for about a minute before rolling it out.
- Turn the dough out onto a floured surface, and roll the dough out until it is about ¼ of an inch thick.
- Now use a small circle cookie cutter or a drinking glass to cut out the dough into disk shapes.
- Prepare a cookie sheet with parchment paper and then move the cut-out circles onto the parchment paper.
- After you have about 12 to 15 circles on each cookie sheet, drop about 2 teaspoons of filling on each cookie.
- Then fold the cookies into triangles, pinching the seams together to make sure they do not pop open while baking.
- Make up the egg wash with the remaining egg and 1 tablespoon of water beaten together.
- Use a pastry brush to coat the unbaked Hamentashen with the egg wash.
- Place the cookie sheet in the oven and bake the cookies at 350°F for 15 to 20 minutes or until the sides are just slightly golden brown.


Recipe Variations

One of the other nice things about this recipe is that you can make it suit you and your family’s taste buds.

While this recipe does not call for any form of lemon or lime zest, you can always add some in to give extra flavor.

Or you can change these cookies up simply by using different fillings. Here are some I like to use:
- Poppy seeds
- Pecans
- Walnuts
- Chocolate
- Lemon pie filling
- Cherry pie filling
- Apricot jam
- Strawberry jam

There are so many options! A great reason to make a variety instead of just one flavor.


How to Fold Hamentashen

To fold these circles into triangles you are going to make three seams.
- First, start by carefully grabbing the top sides of the circle and pinching the top together to create a point.
- Then on the bottom half of the cookie grab one side and bring it together with the top half of the cookie, again pinching the end of the seam together to create a point.
- Now grab the remaining part of the circle that is on the pan, bring it together with the other raised side. Pinch the two together to create the final point of the triangle.


How to Not Overfill the Hamentashen

The best way is to put filling on one of the cookies and attempt to fold it. Generally, it will be about 2 teaspoons but will all depend on the size of the circle cookie cutter you used.

Here’s how to know if the cookies are properly filled after you fold the cookie into the triangle and what to do if overfilled:
- If nothing is coming out of the top then you are good to go.
- If there is filling above the fold of the triangle then remove some and continue with a little less in the rest of the cookies.


How to Store Hamentashen Cookies

After the cookies have cooled down, store them in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 5 to 7 days. These could be left out at room temperature but will last slightly longer in the fridge.


How to Freeze Hamentashen Cookies

If you know you will not need all of the cookies, the best way to freeze these cookies is BEFORE you bake them. Form the cookies and then put the tray in the freezer for an hour or two.

After the cookies are frozen, you can remove them from the tray and keep them in an air-tight container or zip-top bag in the freezer for up to 3 months. They will stay fresher and will not dry out as much as if they had been frozen.
