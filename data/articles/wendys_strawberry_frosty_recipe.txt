Where Can You Get a Wendy’s Strawberry Frosty?

The recent appearance of Wendy’s Strawberry Frosty is berry good news, even though this is an elusive treat. You can only get a strawberry frosty at Wendy’s in just one location in the US, namely, the Wendy’s Hamburger Stand inside the Walmart in Heath, Ohio (close to the fast-food chain’s headquarters).

The recently opened Wendy’s Hamburger Stand also serves other exclusive menu items, including Buttermilk Ranch Nuggets, Jalapeno Cheddar Nuggets, and frosty sundaes in Chocolate Lover and Marshmallow Charms flavors. 

When Wendy’s was established back in 1969, Wendy’s Frosty was one of the five original menu items. The Frosty is made in several flavors, but the strawberry one has become somewhat of an urban legend among US customers, as it was only available in Canada.

We don’t know if Wendy’s has future plans to offer its Frosty at other US locations. However, if you want to enjoy this tasty pink treat, you don’t have to take a road trip to Ohio or hop over the border into Canada to find a strawberry frosty at Wendy’s.

You can stay comfortably at home and create one in your very own kitchen with this Wendy’s Strawberry Frosty copycat recipe.

What Goes With a Strawberry Frosty?

A strawberry frosty is the perfect follow-up to a copycat Wendy’s Strawberry Salad, Baconator, or Wendy’s Chili.


How to Store a Strawberry Frosty

You can make a big batch of strawberry frosty and store it in the freezer for up to a month. The same goes for any leftovers. Be sure to put it in a freezer-safe container.

Note: Cover the glasses in plastic wrap or store them in plastic bags, so your frosty mix doesn’t absorb any odors from your freezer.

The frosty will become frozen solid, so let it sit at room temperature for 30 minutes before enjoying. You can also set the frozen frosty (in its cup) in hot water for a couple of minutes. Or you can run some hot water over the outside of the cup until the frozen frosty will easily come out of the cup.
