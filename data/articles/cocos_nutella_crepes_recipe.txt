Easy Crepes with Nutella Filling

Crepe making isn’t difficult, you may have never tried making your own crepes before. You can buy them premade in many grocery stores in the refrigerated sections, but I prefer to make things homemade when you can.

Making food homemade often means saving money and knowing what is in your food. Crepes have a few simple ingredients.

The real key in making crepes is planning ahead. You mix the batter and then you let the batter rest in the refrigerator for a couple of hours before cooking the crepes.

I don’t advocate purchasing a special pan for making crepes. I use my well-seasoned iron skillet and it works wonderfully.

I advise cooking your crepes slowly, so they don’t brown too much.

Be creative with your crepes. Adding some sliced strawberries, bananas, nuts, and maybe some whipped cream would make for a wonderful dessert too!

Crepes are wonderfully diverse, you can make crepes sweet or savory, the possibilities are endless.


What Makes Nutella Crepes So Good? 

Nutella is terrific stuff. There are at least 101 ways to enjoy this hazelnut and chocolate spread, but one of the best is spreading it inside freshly made crepes.

A thin, crispy crepe oozing chocolatey filling with powdered sugar or whipped cream on top is a sweet way to start the day or end a meal.

As a bonus, crepes store beautifully, so make a batch in advance, and you are only moments away from enjoying these delicious Nutella Crepes. 


Why This Is the One Nutella Filled Crepe Recipe You Should Try 

Are you looking for a simple recipe that’s fancy enough for company and versatile enough to serve for brunch or as a dessert? These crepes with Nutella can feed a crowd and even let your guests customize them to suit their tastes. 


Recipe Ingredients

Here’s a list of what you need:
- All-purpose flour
- Eggs
- Vegetable oil divided use
- Milk
- Salt
- Vanilla extract
- Nutella

You don’t have to use Nutella in this recipe. You can substitute any chocolate-hazelnut spread you want. Pongo Cocoa Hazelnut Protein Spread is an excellent choice to make your crepes a little more filling. 


How to Make Nutella Crepes

This Nutella crepes recipe is straightforward.

To make the crepe batter:
- Crack the eggs into a bowl and then add vegetable oil, half a cup of milk, and salt.
- Whisk them together.
- Add the flour to a large bowl and add the egg mixture.
- Use a hand mixer on low speed to slowly work the wet and dry ingredients together.
- Increase the speed to medium and blend until all the lumps are gone.
- Blend in the vanilla extract and the rest of the milk.
- Cover the bowl and put it in the fridge for two hours. 

To make the crepes:
- Heat a large non-stick skillet with low sides or a crepe pan over medium heat. 
- Dip a paper towel in oil and lightly grease the pan. 
- Lift the pan with one hand and pour a quarter cup of the batter into the center while tipping the pan in a circular motion. Continue swirling the pan to spread the batter to the edges.
- Return the pan to the stovetop and cook until the underside of the crepe is lightly brown. Flip the crepe using your fingers or a crepe spatula. 
- Finish cooking the second side of the crepe and transfer it to a plate.
- Spread the Nutella on half of the crepe and fold the crepe over. Spread more Nutella onto the crepe and fold into a triangle. If you find it challenging to spread the Nutella and wonder how to thin Nutella for crepes, try heating water just below boiling and then dunking the Nutella jar into the hot water for about 45 seconds. 
- Garnish with powdered sugar or whipped cream.
- Serve immediately.


Two Recipe Variations 

Crepes are so flexible you can fill them with almost anything. Two favorites are Banana Nutella Crepes and Strawberry Nutella Crepes.

Just add a few slices of your preferred fruit to the filling or offer platters of fresh fruit and let your guests choose what they want on top.


What To Serve With Nutella Crepes

Sipping a cafe au lait and eating crepes with Nutella is like a mini Parisian vacation you can take any time you want. 

In addition to strawberries and bananas, other toppings you can serve alongside Nutella crepes are crushed walnuts, poached pears, vanilla custard, and raspberries. 


How To Store Crepes 

Stack unfilled crepes with a sheet of wax or parchment paper between each. Wrap the stack of crepes tightly with plastic wrap and put them in the refrigerator for up to four days.

To freeze: Wrap in aluminum foil and put in the freezer for up to three months.

You can keep crepe batter covered in the fridge overnight.


How to Reheat Crepes 

Let any frozen crepes thaw overnight in the fridge. When you are ready to serve: 
- Put the same pan you used to make the crepes on the stove over medium heat.
- Reheat a crepe for a minute on the first side and then flip for another 30 seconds on the other side.
- Fill and serve.
