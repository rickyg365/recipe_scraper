See’s Fudge Ingredients

If you’ve ever made fudge before, then the ingredients will be similar to what you have used for other recipes. However, just in case, take a look at this list to make sure you have what you need for this See’s fudge recipe:
- Butter
- Semi-sweet chocolate – you can use semi sweet chocolate chips 
- Vanilla extract
- Sugar
- Evaporated milk
- Marshmallows
- Nuts – I recommend walnuts 


How to Make See’s Fudge Candy
- Combine butter, chocolate, and vanilla in a medium bowl.
- Place sugar, evaporated milk, and marshmallows in a large saucepan.
- Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring frequently. Use a candy thermometer to monitor the temperature of the mixture.
- When the mixture reaches the soft ball stage (234-240°F), reduce the heat to low and cook for 6 minutes, and do not stir during the six minutes you cook the fudge. 
- Pour the hot mixture into the bowl with butter, chocolate, and vanilla.
- Beat with an electric mixer until the fudge is thick and dull.
- Stir in nuts.
- Pour the fudge mixture into a lightly buttered 8-inch square baking pan.
- Refrigerate for several hours until firm.
- Cut the fudge into pieces.


Tips for Making Fudge
- Use a heavy saucepan with tall sides. This will help to eliminate a mess. One with short sides could allow ingredients to boil over the sides as it is cooking.
- Use a candy thermometer. One of the most important things about making fudge is getting it to the right temperature. Under-cooked fudge will not set properly. Over-cooked fudge will make it grainy, hard, and crumbly.
- Use sturdy wood or silicone spoons and spatulas. Fudge can get thick and a flimsy spoon or spatula could break while stirring it.
- Line your pan. You can coat the pan with butter but it will release from the pan easier if line it with foil coated with non-stick spray, non-stick foil, or parchment paper.
- Use quality ingredients. Cheap chocolate will give not the same results as high-quality chocolate, both in flavor and texture.
- Use full-fat dairy. Whichever the recipe calls for, use full-fat milk, cream, and butter. The fat is what gives fudge its classic mouthfeel.
- Don’t stir the boiling mixture. This causes the sugar to crystalize and will result in grainy fudge.
- Make fudge on a dry day. Humidity can cause fudge to absorb moisture from the air and make it softer than expected.
- Use a sharp knife to cut fudge. This will help make perfectly straight edges. Remember to clean the knife between cuts.


How to Store Fudge

To keep fudge the freshest, you should store pieces of fudge in an airtight container and keep it on your counter at room temperature.

It will last on the counter for 1 to 2 weeks and have the best texture.

If you store fudge in the fridge, it will tend to dry out the fudge. But it will last for 2 to 3 weeks in the refrigerator.


Can you freeze chocolate fudge?

You can freeze fudge, but make sure to wrap it in plastic wrap and then either wrap the fudge in aluminum foil or put it in a freezer-safe plastic bag. You want to lock in the moisture as much as possible.

Fudge will last up to 3 months in the freezer.
