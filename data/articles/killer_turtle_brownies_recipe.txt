- Wrapped Caramels
- Butter
- Chocolate Cake Mix
- Chopped pecans
- Sweetened Condensed Milk
- Semi-sweet Chocolate Chips


Ingredient Notes

For this fancy brownies recipe, you will need to purchase some wrapped caramels found in the candy section of the grocery store. Don’t use caramel sauce because it will not harden like the wrapped caramels.

Use a dark chocolate cake mix to give you deep, full, and rich chocolate flavor.


Ingredient Substitutions and Variations
- Change out the nuts. For instance, walnuts are a good substitute for pecans.
- If you have a nut allergy or are not a fan of nuts, you can omit the pecans. The brownies, however, will no longer be turtle brownies, just caramel brownies – but still delicious!
- Add in some peanut butter chips or combine them with the chocolate chips.
- Add in some sweetened coconut flakes for extra flavor.
