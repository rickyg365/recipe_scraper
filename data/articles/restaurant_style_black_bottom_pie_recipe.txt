Old Fashioned Black Bottom Pie

A trip to Marie Callender’s is just not complete without a slice of Black Bottom Pie at the end of the meal. With its flaky crust, layers of vanilla and chocolate pudding, and a big dollop of whipped cream, it’s no wonder Black Bottom Pie is one of the restaurant’s most popular desserts.

But you don’t have to go out to try this tasty pie when it is so easy to make at home!


What Makes a Black Bottom Pie So Good?

Who doesn’t love a classic pudding pie, especially when the pudding is spiked with the taste of rum? It is definitely the combination of flavors and textures that makes Marie Callender’s Black Bottom Pie so amazing.


Why This is the Best Recipe for Black Bottom Pie

While most Black Bottom Pies use chocolate wafer shortbread crusts, this recipe opts for a standard flaky pie crust giving the pie more of a bite.

Cutting into the pie reveals sophisticated-looking layers of vanilla and chocolate puddings that are actually very easy to pull off.

As a bonus, there are only five ingredients in the entire pie, and most people already have them in their pantries.


Recipe Ingredients

To make this Black Bottom Pie recipe, you will need:
- Plain pastry pie crusts (store-bought or homemade)
- Chocolate pudding mix
- Vanilla pudding mix
- Rum extract
- Whipped cream or Cool Whip topping


Ingredient Substitutions

There is a lot of room to play with the ingredients in this version of Black Bottom Pie, but that doesn’t mean you can’t make it exactly as written. You can, and it is still delicious. But if you have the time and desire to make it your own, try these changes.

Going the instant pudding route instead of making a more typical custard filling saves a lot of time and headaches, and there are high-quality pudding mixes out there like the ones from Godiva. However, nothing compares to making the pudding yourself.

While the recipe calls for using rum extract, you can certainly use a tablespoon of real rum instead. Dark rum is the best, but stay away from the spiced variety.


Recipe Variations

Baking should be fun, so here are a couple of suggestions for tweaking this recipe:
- For even more crunch, you can try adding a layer of crushed chocolate wafer cookies between the two different layers of pudding.
- Use a ganache in place of the chocolate pudding for an even more chocolatey pie.


How to Serve Marie Callender’s Black Bottom Pie

Cut each pie into six slices and serve on a small plate. Add whipped cream if there isn’t any, and you can garnish with chocolate shavings, chocolate chips, or crushed nuts.


What Goes Well With a Black Bottom Pie?

Coffee’s the perfect drink to serve alongside this pie. Its bitterness pairs well with the sweetness of the dessert. For the same reason, if you prefer something alcoholic, choose a bottle of your favorite stout to drink.

Some great coffee drinks are:
- Cafe Mocha
- Cold Brew Coffee
- Flat White Coffee


How to Store Black Bottom Pie

It is not a good idea to freeze any pies containing pudding, but you can keep leftovers in the refrigerator for three to four days.

Wrap the pie loosely in plastic wrap or, better yet, use a pie keeper to protect the whipped cream topping.
