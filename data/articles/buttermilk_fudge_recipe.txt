Why this is the Best Old Fashioned Fudge Recipe

There is nothing crazy about this recipe. It is just like your grandmother would have made it when you were younger.

Around the holidays I always got excited when my grandma would make this homemade fudge as a treat for us because it was our favorite.

It was so smooth and full of flavor with walnuts. The fudge had the perfect creamy consistency and tangy flavor because of the buttermilk she used in the recipe.


What makes buttermilk fudge taste so unique?

The uniqueness of this fudge comes from both the flavor and texture. It’s creamy and it has a wonderful tang with the buttermilk.

Buttermilk is slightly acidic which provides a nice balance with the sweetness of fudge.

This delicious fudge is made with ordinary pantry staples. No need to worry about finding a special ingredient at the store. Take a look at this list to make sure you have what you need in your pantry and fridge.

How to Make Buttermilk Fudge


Fudge Making Tips

You want to avoid any of the sugar from crystallizing on the side of the pan, so when you see them, get a pastry brush wet (not too wet) and carefully wipe it off.

If the sugar does crystalize, it can add chunks into your fudge.

Use a candy thermometer. Temperature is key for making fudge. You need to make sure you hit between 234 and 240 degrees Fahrenheit in order for it to set properly.

If it doesn’t get hot enough, you will have soupy fudge and if it gets too hot you will have burnt and dry fudge.


How to Store Fudge

The best way to store fudge is in an airtight container with wax paper between the layers. Using an airtight container will help keep it fresh the longest.

Storing fudge at room temperature is optimal if you will be eating it within a couple of weeks. If you want to extend the shelf life a bit, you can store fudge in the fridge or freeze it.


Can you freeze fudge?

Yes, fudge can be frozen. Wrap it with wax paper then with aluminum foil. Place the wrapped fudge in a freezer-safe airtight container or freezer bag.

Put the container in the back of the freezer to keep it from temperature fluctuations from the door opening and closing. Freeze it for up to 3 months.

When you’re ready to eat the fudge, take it out of the freezer and thaw it for 2 to 3 hours.


How long does fudge last?

When properly stored in an airtight container, the fudge will last:
- 1 to 2 weeks at room temperature
- 2 to 3 weeks in the refrigerator
- Up to 3 months in the freezer
