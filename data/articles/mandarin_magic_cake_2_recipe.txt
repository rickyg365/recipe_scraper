Recipe Ingredients

Be sure to have all of these ingredients on hand to be able to make this cake whenever the mood strikes! I promise you will have cravings for it after you’ve had it once.
- Yellow cake mix (Duncan Hines or Better Crocker)
- Eggs
- All-purpose flour
- Vegetable oil
- Canned mandarin oranges – This provides the amazing flavor of the cake, also make sure to keep the juice.
- Canned crushed pineapple
- Instant vanilla pudding mix
- Cool Whip – Be sure to use Cool Whip and not whipped cream because the consistency is key for the frosting.


How to Make Mandarin Orange Cake
- Start by preheating the oven to 350 degrees.
- Then in a large mixing bowl, mix together the cake mix, flour, eggs, oil, and the whole can of mandarins (including the juices) until it is well combined.
- Pour the batter into a 9×13-inch pan that has been greased and floured ahead of time.
- Once the cake has been evenly spread in the pan, place it in the oven and let it bake for 30 minutes or until you can insert a toothpick in the center of the cake and it comes out clean.
- Remove the cake from the oven and let it cool completely.
- When the cake is almost done cooling, mix together the whole can of crushed pineapple (pour the juice in too) with the instant vanilla powder and Cool Whip.
- After the frosting is fully mixed together (this will not be smooth because of the pineapple chunks), spread the frosting over top of the cooled cake.
- Place the cake in the refrigerator until you are ready to serve.


Recipe Variations

If you are not a huge fan of pineapples you can always use another can of mandarin oranges in place of the pineapples or even change it to your favorite frosting recipe. Cream cheese frosting would work well too.

Another idea would be to use peaches instead of oranges. If you choose to do that, blend up the peaches slightly before using them in the cake.

Peaches do not break down as easily as mandarin oranges. But imagine what a peaches and cream cake would taste like.


How to Serve Mandarin Orange Cake

A lot of cakes you generally keep at room temperature, but not this cake. Mandarin orange pineapple cake is served cool and it adds even more to the cake by serving it cold.

This is such a fresh and refreshing cake. Serving it cold makes this fruity dessert stand out even more.


What Goes Well With Orange Mandarin Cake?

Since this is such a refreshing cake, it is often served with fresh fruit and a sweet cream cheese dip. Or if you are having a little get-together you can make up a fruit pizza or fresh fruit salsa to go with the mandarin cake and serve it with cinnamon sugar chips.

If you are having this cake later in the day, this would also work well with a wonderful mint mojito!


How to Store the Orange Cake

It is essential that this cake is either wrapped with foil or plastic wrap or has a lid on it and is stored in the fridge. The cake will be best for 2 to 3 days. After that, the frosting will begin to break down a bit.


Can You Freeze Mandarin Orange Cake?

I’ll be honest, this cake does not freeze well whole, and so I would not try it that way.

If you do want to freeze it, I would suggest just making the cake part and freezing it. Then you are ready to serve the cake, pull it out of the freezer and let it thaw. Frost it after it is completely thawed.
