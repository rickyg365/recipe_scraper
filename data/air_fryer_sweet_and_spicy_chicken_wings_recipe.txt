And if you happen to have an air fryer at home, you are all set to cook up some fabulous air fryer chicken wings at home. Air fryer chicken is just as good as traditional deep-fried wings with a whole less fat. If you love sweet and spicy food, and you happen to have an air fryer, you need to try this air fryer wings recipe!


Preparing the Chicken Wings

You can buy chicken wings already cut into wingettes and drumettes, but it will cost you more for the convenience. Instead, purchase full wings and cut them up yourself.

Stretch out the chicken wing on a cutting board so that part of the wing sticks up towards you. You can see three separate sections: the winglet (the part sticking up), the drumette (the middle portion), and the wingtip (at the top). Use your fingers to feel where each section connects to the next. You should be able to find where the end of bones connects. Use the tip of a sharp knife to cut between these bones carefully. Keep the drumettes and winglets to make the air fryer chicken wings, discard the wingtips, or save them making chicken stock.


How to Use an Air Fryer for Cooking Crispy Chicken Wings

Each air fryer is slightly different, so be sure to refer to the owner’s manual for your model for the best results. However, most of these suggestions will work for all air fryers.

Use a paper towel with cooking oil on it to grease the air fryer basket lightly. Make sure you get a good coating of oil, especially around the holes of the basket. Use a neutral oil that has a high smoke point, like canola oil. Set the basket aside as you prepare the chicken.

The enemy of crispy chicken is moisture, so make sure your chicken wings are bone dry before coating them in the dry spice mixture and laying them out on a cooling rack. Wait 30 minutes to allow the spice to flavor the inside of the wing.

Before placing the chicken wings into the frying basket, give the chicken a good shake to knock off any excess spice mixture and give a light spray of cooking oil. The little extra cooking oil will help the chicken develop a deep golden color and crispy skin. Remember not to stack the chicken wings on top of each other in the basket. If your basket is on the small side, you may need to cook in several batches. The total air fryer chicken wings cook time is 30 minutes.


Tips For Preparing Sweet and Spicy Air Fryer Wings
- Don’t oversauce your wings. The goal is only to coat the wings with sweet and sour sauce. You don’t want them to be dripping with sauce. If you wish, you can serve with extra sauce on the side.
- Be careful when flipping the wings. Use tongs or chopsticks to avoid burning yourself.

Recommended Equipment

You need an air fryer, but which one? There are so many models out there.

If you are cooking for just 1 to 2 people I really like the Phillips Air Fryer because it doesn’t take up a lot of counter space, and it is a workhorse. I have heated up slices of pizza, egg rolls, made grilled cheese sandwiches in here and so much more. 

If you have a larger family, or a larger budget the Breville Smart Oven can air fry, bake, proof bread, and so much more. Its capacity is very large. You can make food for 4 to 6 people in his model.
